The data in the files:
- add.unsorted.txt
- add.sorted.txt

... come from the Project Gutenberg website (http://www.gutenberg.org), and 
contain text from the following pieces of literature:

 - The Graymouse Family
 - The Mysterious Key And What It Opened
 - By Sheer Pluck: A Tale of the Ashanti War  
 - Poems, by Robert Southey
 - Sanders' Union Fourth Reader

These texts split each word into its own line, removing any non-word-like 
characters and stored in the files mentioned above.  This was accomplished
with the split.sed file in this directory.

The file add.sorted.txt was sorted using the Unix command line utility 'sort'
with the environmental variable: 

LC_COLLATE=C
