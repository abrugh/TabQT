1 THE
1 GRAYMOUSE
1 HOME
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 with
1 her
1 family
1 lived
1 in
1 a
1 cosy
1 attic
1 which
1 was
1 as
1 snug
1 and
1 comfortable
1 as
1 any
1 good
1 mouse
1 could
1 wish
1 Her
1 children
1 were
1 named
1 Limpy
1 -toes
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 Buster
1 Teenty
1 and
1 Tiny
1 and
1 Baby
1 Squealer
1 Although
1 they
1 had
1 many
1 faults
1 upon
1 the
1 whole
1 they
1 were
1 good
1 children
1 and
1 made
1 a
1 happy
1 family
1 On
1 pleasant
1 mornings
1 the
1 sun
1 shone
1 in
1 bright
1 and
1 warm
1 through
1 the
1 dainty
1 cobweb
1 curtains
1 of
1 their
1 east
1 window
1 In
1 the
1 summer
1 -time
1 robins
1 and
1 orioles
1 sang
1 sweetly
1 among
1 the
1 green
1 branches
1 of
1 the
1 maple
1 tree
1 which
1 shaded
1 the
1 west
1 window
1 Even
1 when
1 it
1 stormed
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 and
1 her
1 little
1 ones
1 enjoyed
1 the
1 patter
1 patter
1 of
1 the
1 rain
1 -drops
1 upon
1 the
1 roof
1 and
1 window
1 -panes
1 They
1 were
1 thankful
1 for
1 such
1 a
1 good
1 home
1 The
1 house
1 in
1 which
1 they
1 lived
1 belonged
1 to
1 a
1 family
1 of
1 giants
1 There
1 was
1 Mr
1 Giant
1 his
1 wife
1 and
1 two
1 little
1 Giants
1 The
1 little
1 girl
1 was
1 a
1 pretty
1 child
1 named
1 Ruth
1 with
1 blue
1 eyes
1 and
1 long
1 yellow
1 curls
1 Her
1 brother
1 Robert
1 looked
1 almost
1 exactly
1 like
1 her
1 except
1 that
1 his
1 yellow
1 curls
1 were
1 shorter
1 he
1 wore
1 bigger
1 boots
1 that
1 made
1 more
1 noise
1 and
1 instead
1 of
1 playing
1 with
1 dolls
1 and
1 tea
1 -sets
1 he
1 liked
1 balls
1 and
1 bats
1 and
1 air
1 -rifles
1 After
1 Mr
1 Giant
1 had
1 fitted
1 up
1 half
1 of
1 the
1 attic
1 for
1 his
1 children
1 s
1 play
1 -room
1 life
1 was
1 much
1 jollier
1 for
1 the
1 little
1 Graymouses
1 The
1 steam
1 heat
1 from
1 the
1 play
1 -room
1 came
1 through
1 the
1 cracks
1 and
1 made
1 their
1 home
1 as
1 warm
1 as
1 toast
1 Limpy
1 -toes
1 and
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 worked
1 busily
1 away
1 until
1 there
1 were
1 three
1 holes
1 through
1 which
1 they
1 could
1 steal
1 softly
1 in
1 and
1 watch
1 Ruth
1 and
1 Robert
1 at
1 their
1 play
1 Since
1 Christmas
1 the
1 attic
1 had
1 become
1 a
1 merry
1 noisy
1 place
1 I
1 wonder
1 how
1 those
1 young
1 Giants
1 manage
1 to
1 make
1 such
1 a
1 racket
1 grumbled
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 I

1 Squeaky
1 gleefully
1 Just
1 listen
1 to
1 that
1 One
1 would
1 think
1 I
1 was
1 a
1 walking
1 candy
1 store
1 and
1 a
1 story
1 book
1 all

1 Very
1 sorry
1 Buster
1 Boy
1 but
1 I
1 haven
1 t
1 a
1 single
1 peppermint
1 in
1 my
1 pocket
1 I
1 think
1 you
1 ought
1 not
1 to
1 eat
1 so
1 much
1 candy
1 You
1 are
1 too
1 fat
1 already
1 As
1 for
1 stories
1 you
1 kiddies
1 have
1 heard
1 every
1 tale
1 that
1 this
1 old
1 gray
1 head
1 holds
1 time
1 and
1 time
1 again
1 He
1 watched
1 the
1 five
1 sober
1 little
1 faces
1 as
1 they
1 sat
1 upon
1 their
1 red
1 -painted
1 stools
1 with
1 their
1 paws
1 folded
1 primly
1 in

1 Then
1 he
1 winked
1 slyly
1 at
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 Oh
1 well
1 if
1 you
1 are
1 going
1 to
1 feel
1 as
1 bad
1 as
1 all
1 that
1 perhaps
1 I
1 might
1 manage
1 to
1 tell
1 you
1 one
1 more
1 story
1 he
1 chuckled
1 But
1 I
1 think
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 will
1 hardly
1 call
1 it
1 exciting
1 And
1 I
1 wonder
1 if
1 you
1 little
1 folk
1 could
1 make
1 some
1 checkermints
1 do
1 He
1 drew
1 forth
1 a
1 handful
1 of
1 pink
1 candies
1 from

1 gave
1 them

1 The

1 very

1 and
1 clever
1 at

1 He
1 was

1 the

1 in

1 continued
1 Uncle
1 Squeaky
1 He
1 was
1 fat
1 as
1 a

1 ball
1 so
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 squeeze
1 through
1 holes
1 to
1 hunt
1 for
1 food
1 with
1 the
1 others
1 He
1 ate
1 so
1 many
1 goodies
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 too
1 tired
1 to
1 do
1 much
1 work
1 so
1 he
1 had
1 to
1 sit
1 on
1 his
1 little
1 red
1 stool
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 time
1 But
1 he
1 could
1 sometimes
1 sing
1 the

1 to
1 sleep
1 which
1 was
1 a
1 great
1 blessing
1 He
1 was
1 a

1 Buster
1 blinked
1 sleepily
1 It

1 excused
1 Mother

1 Now

1 sighed
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 and
1 so
1 he
1 is
1 a
1 comfort
1 too
1 Then
1 there
1 was
1 a

1 of

1 resumed
1 Uncle
1 Squeaky
1 The
1 two
1 of

1 wouldn

1 good
1 sized
1 mouse
1 But
1 it
1 did
1 not
1 take
1 much
1 stuff
1 for
1 their
1 dresses
1 and
1 they
1 could
1 steal
1 through
1 the
1 tiniest
1 teentiest
1 holes
1 which
1 was
1 often
1 very
1 handy
1 for
1 the
1 whole
1 family
1 How
1 they
1 all
1 clapped
1 for
1 Tiny
1 and
1 Teenty
1 Hush
1 cautioned
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 If
1 we
1 make
1 too
1 much
1 noise
1 the
1 Giant
1 may
1 be
1 angry
1 and
1 turn
1 us
1 out

1 Then

1 one
1 stormy
1 night
1 when

1 He
1 reminded

1 that

1 He
1 paused

1 Traps

1 CHAPTER
1 VI
1 BUSTER
1 AND
1 THE
1 CHOCOLATES
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 hot
1 summer
1 day
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 had
1 taken
1 her
1 children
1 out
1 for
1 a
1 stroll
1 in
1 the
1 fields
1 Only
1 Buster
1 remained
1 at
1 home
1 He
1 had
1 been
1 naughty
1 and
1 was
1 punished
1 by
1 being
1 left
1 behind
1 I
1 d
1 rather
1 lie
1 here
1 and
1 read
1 my
1 picture
1 book
1 than
1 trot
1 around
1 in
1 the
1 hot
1 sunshine
1 he
1 thought
1 If
1 only
1 I
1 had
1 some
1 candy
1 I
1 would
1 be
1 quite
1 happy
1 After
1 he
1 had
1 looked
1 at
1 all
1 the
1 pictures
1 and
1 read
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 shortest
1 stories
1 he
1 shut
1 the
1 book
1 and
1 began
1 to
1 sing
1 softly
1 to
1 himself
1 By
1 -and
1 -by
1 he
1 grew
1 restless
1 Oh
1 dear
1 I
1 m
1 not
1 one
1 bit
1 sleepy
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 take
1 another
1 nap
1 I
1 wish
1 I
1 had
1 some
1 candy
1 I
1 wonder
1 -
1 -
1 Then
1 he
1 pushed
1 Baby
1 Squealer
1 s
1 high
1 -chair
1 over
1 to
1 the
1 cupboard
1 and
1 climbed
1 up
1 until
1 he
1 could
1 reach
1 the
1 shelf
1 where
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 had
1 put
1 the
1 Christmas
1 candy
1 It
1 was
1 gone
1 every
1 single
1 piece
1 Illustration
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 hot
1 summer
1 day
1 Oh
1 I
1 know
1 remembered
1 Buster
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 had
1 a
1 birthday
1 party
1 last
1 night
1 I
1 think
1 there
1 may
1 be
1 some
1 candy
1 in
1 the
1 play
1 -room
1 It
1 will
1 do
1 no
1 harm
1 to
1 look
1 He
1 stole
1 softly
1 into
1 the
1 play
1 -room
1 on
1 tiptoe
1 lest
1 old
1 Thomas
1 Cat
1 might
1 be
1 prowling
1 about
1 and
1 hear
1 him
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 was
1 sitting
1 among
1 the
1 pillows
1 upon
1 the
1 couch
1 reading
1 a
1 book
1 Beside
1 her
1 was
1 a
1 box
1 of
1 splendid
1 chocolates
1 Now
1 and
1 then
1 she
1 ate
1 one
1 Buster
1 hid
1 behind
1 the
1 doll
1 s
1 dresser
1 and
1 waited
1 At
1 last
1 he
1 got
1 impatient
1 She
1 will
1 eat
1 em
1 all
1 up
1 and
1 I
1 know
1 they
1 are
1 real
1 good
1 he
1 fussed
1 Mammy
1 will
1 come
1 home
1 and
1 call
1 me
1 pretty
1 soon
1 Oh
1 why
1 doesn
1 t
1 somebody
1 call
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 down
1 -stairs
1 I
1 wonder
1 if
1 she
1 would
1 think
1 I
1 was
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 and
1 toss
1 me
1 some
1 candy
1 It
1 can
1 t
1 be
1 poison
1 for
1 she
1 is
1 eating
1 it
1 her
1 own
1 self
1 At
1 last
1 such
1 a
1 long
1 at
1 last
1 Buster
1 thought
1 Ruth
1 closed
1 her
1 book
1 and
1 went
1 away
1 How
1 Buster
1 did
1 hurry
1 to
1 get
1 his
1 greedy
1 little
1 paws
1 into
1 that
1 box
1 of
1 chocolates
1 He
1 ran
1 home
1 with
1 one
1 frisked
1 back
1 for
1 another
1 and
1 still
1 another
1 until
1 the
1 very
1 last
1 one
1 of
1 Ruth
1 s
1 fine
1 chocolates
1 was
1 added
1 to
1 the
1 delicious
1 heap
1 on
1 Buster
1 s
1 bed
1 My
1 but
1 that
1 was
1 hard
1 work
1 panted
1 the
1 fat
1 lazy
1 little
1 fellow
1 I
1 wonder
1 where
1 I
1 can
1 hide
1 em
1 so
1 I
1 can
1 have
1 candy
1 to
1 nibble
1 when
1 I
1 want
1 it
1 Down
1 behind
1 an
1 old
1 trunk
1 was
1 a
1 pair
1 of
1 old
1 boots
1 that
1 Mr
1 Giant
1 had
1 brought
1 to
1 the
1 attic
1 They
1 were
1 rather
1 musty
1 and
1 dusty
1 but
1 Buster
1 decided
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 quite
1 safe
1 to
1 hide
1 his
1 candy
1 in
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 So
1 he
1 trotted
1 back
1 and
1 forth
1 until
1 half
1 of
1 the
1 chocolates
1 were
1 stored
1 away
1 in
1 the
1 toe
1 of
1 a
1 boot
1 I
1 guess
1 I
1 can
1 eat
1 the
1 rest
1 before
1 Mammy
1 comes
1 for
1 I
1 m
1 real
1 hungry
1 for
1 candy
1 thought
1 Buster
1 He
1 lay
1 down
1 on
1 his
1 little
1 bed
1 and
1 snuggled
1 cosily
1 among
1 the
1 pillows
1 with
1 his
1 book
1 and
1 candy
1 Just
1 like
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 he
1 thought
1 proudly
1 as
1 he
1 nibbled
1 a
1 chocolate
1 It
1 is
1 almost
1 as
1 good
1 as
1 having
1 a
1 birthday
1 party
1 of
1 my
1 own
1 And
1 it
1 is
1 much
1 nicer
1 than
1 tramping
1 around
1 out
1 of
1 doors
1 if
1 Mammy
1 does
1 call
1 it
1 a
1 picnic
1 hen
1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 returned
1 the
1 children
1 were
1 all
1 eager
1 to
1 tell
1 Buster
1 about
1 their
1 good
1 time
1 in
1 the
1 fields
1 e
1 went
1 down
1 the
1 lane
1 said
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 and
1 found
1 lots
1 of
1 sweet
1 wild
1 flowers
1 And
1 we
1 met
1 Mr
1 Hop
1 Toad
1 and
1 his
1 wife
1 out
1 for
1 a
1 stroll
1 added
1 Limpy
1 -toes
1 Yes
1 and
1 we
1 saw
1 Pete
1 and
1 Dickie
1 Grasshopper
1 and
1 Madame
1 Butterfly
1 also
1 e
1 had
1 our
1 lunch
1 in
1 a
1 lovely
1 grove
1 of

1 Tiny
1 s
1 shrill
1 little
1 voice
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 lovely
1 cool
1 grove
1 echoed
1 Teenty
1 and
1 we
1 had
1 a
1 nice
1 lunch
1 Buster
1 listened
1 sleepily
1 Now
1 and
1 then
1 he
1 rubbed
1 his
1 stomach
1 ere
1 you
1 lonely
1 Buster
1 asked
1 his

1 Mother
1 Graymouse
1 hastened
1 to

1 time
1 Granny

1 dose
1 Then
1 he
1 began
1 to

1 grew
1 frightened
1 Uncle
1 Squeaky

1 then
1 Stop

1 Buster
1 stopped
1 choking
1 at
1 once
1 Soon

1 SILVER
1 EARS
1 ADVENTURE
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 rainy
1 day
1 Big
1 drops
1 splashed
1 against
1 the
1 window
1 -panes
1 and
1 drummed
1 upon
1 the
1 attic
1 roof
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 was
1 restless
1 She
1 had
1 helped
1 Mammy
1 sweep
1 the
1 floor
1 had
1 wiped
1 the
1 dishes
1 and
1 rocked
1 Baby
1 Squealer
1 to
1 sleep
1 She
1 did
1 not
1 wish
1 to
1 sew
1 any
1 more
1 patchwork
1 squares
1 She
1 could
1 hear
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 laughing
1 softly
1 in
1 the
1 play
1 -room
1 I
1 d
1 like
1 to
1 be
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 s
1 pet
1 she
1 thought
1 wistfully
1 That
1 strawberry
1 jam
1 cake
1 was
1 lovely
1 and
1 so
1 were
1 the
1 chocolates
1 and
1 pop
1 -corn
1 I
1 mean
1 to
1 visit
1 her
1 again
1 I
1 know
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 is
1 not
1 an
1 enemy
1 Mammy
1 need
1 not
1 fear
1 She
1 tied
1 her
1 pink
1 ribbon
1 bow
1 under
1 her
1 chin
1 and
1 without
1 a
1 word
1 to
1 anyone
1 slipped
1 through
1 a
1 hole
1 into
1 the
1 play
1 -room
1 But
1 oh
1 dear
1 me
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 had
1 company
1 A
1 little
1 girl
1 with
1 brown
1 curls
1 and
1 great
1 brown
1 eyes
1 was
1 sitting
1 in
1 Ruth
1 Giant
1 s
1 rocking
1 -chair
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 hid
1 behind
1 the
1 doll
1 s
1 dresser
1 which
1 stood
1 near
1 the
1 biggest
1 hole
1 Perhaps
1 Ruth
1 would
1 not
1 want
1 her
1 for
1 a
1 pet
1 to
1 -day
1 Maybe
1 the
1 other
1 girl
1 would
1 be
1 afraid
1 of
1 a
1 mouse
1 Some
1 girls
1 were
1 silly
1 just
1 like
1 that
1 So
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 waited
1 and
1 listened
1 Let
1 s
1 play
1 dinner
1 -party
1 Dorothy
1 Ruth
1 was
1 saying
1 I
1 like
1 to

1 -party
1 on
1 rainy
1 days
1 It
1 is
1 ever
1 so
1 cosy
1 e
1 must
1 dress
1 the
1 dolls
1 in
1 their
1 prettiest
1 gowns
1 The
1 two
1 girls
1 worked
1 busily
1 away
1 putting
1 dainty
1 white
1 dresses
1 upon
1 their
1 flaxen
1 -haired
1 dolls
1 Silver
1 Ears
1 listened
1 with
1 great
1 interest
1 She
1 learned
1 that
1 the
1 dark
1 -eyed
1 doll
1 with
1 the
1 red
1 sash
1 was
1 Pansy
1 Daisy
1 wore
1 a
1 blue
1 ribbon
1 to
1 match
1 her
1 eyes
1 while
1 the
1 one
1 who
1 was
1 dressed
1 in
1 yellow
1 silk
1 was
1 named
1 Rose
1 They
1 were
1 very
1 stylish
1 dolls
1 and
1 wore
1 lace
1 collars
1 pretty
1 hair
1 ribbons
1 and
1 strings
1 of
1 beads
1 It
1 took
1 quite
1 a
1 while
1 to
1 get
1 them
1 ready
1 for
1 the
1 party
1 Now
1 if
1 you
1 will
1 spread
1 this
1 napkin
1 on
1 the
1 table
1 Dorothy
1 I
1 will
1 go
1 down
1 and

1 Ruth
1 Dorothy
1 set
1 the
1 tiny
1 table
1 with
1 a
1 cunning
1 tea
1 -set
1 of
1 white
1 and
1 gold

1 Oh

1 Dinner

1 Oh

1 until
1 I
1 saw

1 Chicken
1 jam
1 frosted
1 cake
1 The
1 minute
1 the
1 play
1 -room
1 door
1 was
1 closed
1 she
1 invited
1 herself
1 to
1 dinner
1 Daisy
1 Pansy
1 and
1 Rose
1 looked
1 smilingly
1 on
1 and
1 said
1 never
1 a
1 word
1 while
1 she
1 nibbled
1 some
1 cake
1 and
1 dipped
1 her
1 paw
1 daintily
1 into
1 the
1 jam
1 Then
1 she
1 tried
1 the
1 chicken
1 It
1 was
1 the
1 most
1 delicious
1 chicken
1 she
1 had
1 ever
1 tasted
1 I
1 hope
1 it
1 will
1 take
1 that
1 Norah
1 Maid
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 cocoa
1 she

1 and
1 her

1 the
1 chicken
1 as
1 fast
1 as
1 ever
1 they
1 could
1 By
1 -and
1 -by
1 Silver
1 Ears

1 Seizing
1 a
1 slice
1 of

1 she
1 whisked
1 softly
1 into
1 the
1 doll
1 s
1 bed
1 and

1 kept

1 Now
1 we

1 laughed
1 Ruth
1 I
1 think

1 make
1 Tommy
1 sit
1 beside

1 He

1 good
1 at

1 I

1 not
1 to

1 on
1 the

1 Silver
1 Ears
1 began
1 to

1 So
1 that
1 cross
1 old
1 Tom
1 Cat
1 was
1 a
1 guest
1 at
1 the
1 dinner
1 -party
1 That

1 Tom
1 with

1 And
1 where
1 in
1 the

1 Ruth
1 paused
1 suddenly
1 to

1 Tommy
1 He
1 was
1 acting
1 strangely
1 He
1 sniffed
1 at
1 the
1 table
1 hopped
1 down
1 and
1 ran
1 straight
1 to
1 the
1 doll

1 She
1 darted
1 across

1 room
1 and
1 squeezed
1 through

1 hole
1 just
1 as
1 Tom
1 s
1 sharp
1 claws
1 reached
1 out
1 to
1 grab
1 her
1 She
1 slipped
1 safely
1 through
1 to
1 the
1 other
1 side
1 and
1 Tom
1 went
1 angrily
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 empty
1 bed
1 switching
1 his
1 long
1 tail
1 He
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 content
1 with
1 a
1 piece
1 of
1 cold
1 chicken
1 for
1 his
1 dinner
1 that

1 trotted
1 bravely
1 on

1 Granny
1 It

1 not
1 easy
1 to

1 on

1 Eve
1 But
1 at
1 last
1 Baby
1 Squealer
1 stopped
1 squealing
1 the
1 twins
1 giggled
1 themselves
1 to
1 the
1 Land
1 of

1 ink
1 and
1 iggle
1 could
1 not

1 eyes
1 open
1 any

1 and
1 the
1 four

1 asleep
1 for
1 they

1 worked
1 hard
1 that
1 day
1 cracking
1 nuts
1 for
1 Mammy
1 s
1 cake
1 and
1 seeding
1 raisins
1 for
1 Aunt
1 Squeaky
1 s
1 Christmas
1 pudding
1 hen
1 the
1 clock
1 struck
1 eleven
1 strange
1 to
1 say
1 it
1 was
1 Buster
1 s
1 eyes
1 which
1 were
1 still
1 wide
1 open
1 He
1 was
1 usually
1 very
1 sleepy
1 but
1 to
1 -night
1 he
1 was
1 very
1 curious
1 He
1 wanted
1 to
1 see
1 Santa
1 trim
1 that
1 tree
1 So
1 he
1 winked
1 and
1 he
1 blinked
1 under
1 his
1 blankets
1 keeping
1 real
1 still
1 and
1 pretending
1 to
1 be
1 asleep
1 And
1 what
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 Grand
1 -daddy
1 began
1 to
1 hang
1 pieces
1 of
1 cheese
1 on
1 the
1 tree
1 Aunt
1 Squeaky
1 tiptoed
1 in
1 with

1 of
1 cute
1 little
1 hemstitched
1 handkerchiefs
1 Mammy
1 had
1 a
1 handful
1 of
1 gay
1 ribbon
1 bows
1 and
1 neckties
1 and
1 Granny
1 was
1 hanging
1 up
1 ten
1 pair
1 of
1 scarlet
1 mittens
1 Uncle
1 Squeaky
1 brought
1 in
1 a
1 red
1 double
1 -runner
1 sled
1 and
1 pushed
1 it
1 under
1 the
1 tree
1 I
1 guess
1 Santa
1 is
1 a
1 joke
1 chuckled
1 Buster
1 sleepily
1 on
1 t
1 we
1 have
1 fun
1 sliding
1 on
1 that
1 double
1 -runner
1 Uncle
1 has
1 made
1 Quite
1 happy
1 he
1 closed
1 his
1 eyes
1 and
1 went
1 sound
1 asleep
1 He
1 awoke
1 suddenly
1 when
1 the
1 clock
1 struck
1 one
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 jingle
1 of
1 sleigh
1 bells
1 the
1 reindeer
1 were
1 racing
1 across
1 the
1 frozen
1 snow
1 and
1 there
1 in
1 the
1 bright
1 moonlight
1 was
1 old
1 Santa
1 trimming
1 their
1 tree
1 Buster
1 gazed
1 in
1 wonder
1 while
1 the
1 fat
1 old
1 fellow
1 tied
1 on
1 handkerchiefs
1 red
1 mittens
1 cream
1 cheese
1 ribbon
1 bows
1 and
1 candies
1 hy
1 he
1 was
1 even
1 pushing
1 a
1 sled
1 under
1 the
1 tree
1 That
1 is
1 queer
1 thought
1 Buster
1 drowsily
1 Bright
1 and
1 early
1 next
1 morning
1 ten
1 little
1 mice
1 were
1 dancing
1 about
1 their
1 tree
1 Sure
1 enough
1 Buster
1 found
1 it
1 loaded
1 with
1 the
1 very
1 presents
1 he
1 expected
1 Grand
1 -daddy
1 did
1 you
1 trim
1 our
1 tree
1 or

1 Santa
1 he
1 demanded
1 hy
1 do
1 you
1 ask
1 such
1 funny
1 questions
1 Buster
1 Boy
1 laughed
1 Grand
1 -daddy
1 Then
1 Buster
1 told
1 all
1 he
1 had
1 seen
1 in
1 the
1 night
1 You
1 must
1 have
1 eaten
1 too
1 much
1 cheese
1 for
1 supper
1 chuckled
1 Uncle
1 Squeaky
1 Cheese
1 always
1 makes
1 me
1 dream
1 But
1 did
1 I
1 dream
1 about
1 Santa
1 or

1 and
1 Grand
1 -daddy
1 and

1 insisted
1 Buster
1 ell

1 said
1 in

1 My
1 love
1 that
1 book
1 is
1 a
1 history
1 of

1 for

1 The
1 stormy
1 nature
1 came
1 in

1 Sir

1 the
1 fierce

1 knight
1 who
1 killed
1 his

1 in

1 cousin
1 That
1 has

1 the

1 of
1 our
1 family
1 in

1 Being
1 too
1 proud
1 to
1 mate

1 we
1 have
1 kept
1 to
1 ourselves
1 till
1 idiots
1 and
1 lunatics
1 began
1 to
1 appear
1 My
1 father
1 was
1 the
1 first
1 who
1 broke
1 the
1 law
1 among
1 us
1 and
1 I
1 followed
1 his
1 example
1 choosing
1 the
1 freshest
1 sturdiest
1 flower
1 I
1 could
1 find
1 to
1 transplant
1 into
1 our
1 exhausted
1 soil
1 I
1 hope
1 it
1 will
1 do
1 you
1 honor
1 by
1 blossoming
1 bravely
1 I
1 never
1 forget
1 that
1 you
1 took
1 me
1 from
1 a
1 very
1 humble
1 home
1 and
1 have
1 made
1 me
1 the
1 happiest
1 wife
1 in
1 England
1 And
1 I
1 never
1 forget
1 that
1 you
1 a
1 girl
1 of
1 eighteen
1 consented
1 to
1 leave
1 your
1 hills
1 and
1 come
1 to
1 cheer
1 the
1 long
1 -deserted
1 house
1 of
1 an
1 old
1 man
1 like
1 me
1 returned
1 her
1 husband
1 fondly
1 Nay
1 don

1 yourself
1 old
1 Richard
1 you
1 are
1 only
1 forty
1 -five
1 the
1 boldest
1 handsomest
1 man
1 in

1 But
1 lately
1 you
1 look
1 worried
1 what
1 is
1 it
1 Tell
1 me
1 and
1 let
1 me
1 advise
1 or
1 comfort
1 you
1 It
1 is
1 nothing
1 Alice
1 except
1 my
1 natural
1 anxiety
1 for
1 you
1 -
1 -ell
1 Kingston
1 what
1 do
1 you
1 want
1 Trevlyn
1 s
1 tender
1 tones
1 grew
1 sharp
1 as
1 he
1 addressed
1 the
1 entering
1 servant
1 and
1 the
1 smile
1 on
1 his
1 lips
1 vanished
1 leaving
1 them
1 dry
1 and
1 white
1 as
1 he
1 glanced
1 at
1 the
1 card
1 he
1 handed
1 him
1 An
1 instant
1 he
1 stood
1 staring
1 at
1 it
1 then
1 asked
1 Is
1 the
1 man
1 here
1 In
1 the
1 library
1 sir
1 I
1 ll
1 come
1 Flinging
1 the
1 card
1 into
1 the
1 fire
1 he
1 watched
1 it
1 turn
1 to
1 ashes
1 before
1 he
1 spoke
1 with
1 averted
1 eyes
1 Only
1 some
1 annoying
1 business
1 love
1 I
1 shall
1 soon
1 be
1 with
1 you
1 again
1 Lie
1 and
1 rest
1 till
1 I
1 come
1 ith
1 a
1 hasty
1 caress
1 he
1 left
1 her
1 but
1 as
1 he
1 passed
1 a
1 mirror
1 his
1 wife
1 saw
1 an
1 expression
1 of
1 intense
1 excitement
1 in
1 his
1 face
1 She
1 said
1 nothing
1 and
1 lay
1 motionless
1 for
1 several
1 minutes
1 evidently
1 struggling
1 with
1 some
1 strong
1 impulse
1 He
1 is
1 ill
1 and
1 anxious
1 but
1 hides
1 it
1 from
1 me
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 right
1 to
1 know
1 and
1 he
1 ll
1 forgive
1 me
1 when
1 I
1 prove
1 that
1 it
1 does
1 no
1 harm
1 As
1 she
1 spoke
1 to
1 herself
1 she
1 rose
1 glided
1 noiselessly
1 through
1 the
1 hall
1 entered
1 a
1 small
1 closet
1 built
1 in
1 the
1 thickness
1 of
1 the
1 wall
1 and
1 bending
1 to
1 the
1 keyhole
1 of
1 a
1 narrow
1 door
1 listened
1 with
1 a
1 half
1 -smile
1 on
1 her
1 lips
1 at
1 the
1 trespass
1 she
1 was
1 committing
1 A
1 murmur
1 of
1 voices
1 met
1 her
1 ear
1 Her
1 husband
1 spoke
1 oftenest
1 and
1 suddenly
1 some
1 word
1 of
1 his
1 dashed
1 the
1 smile
1 from
1 her
1 face
1 as
1 if
1 with
1 a
1 blow
1 She
1 started
1 shrank
1 and
1 shivered
1 bending
1 lower
1 with
1 set
1 teeth
1 white
1 cheeks
1 and
1 panic
1 -stricken
1 heart
1 Paler
1 and
1 paler
1 grew
1 her
1 lips
1 wilder
1 and
1 wilder
1 her
1 eyes
1 fainter
1 and
1 fainter
1 her
1 breath
1 till
1 with
1 a
1 long
1 sigh
1 a
1 vain
1 effort
1 to
1 save
1 herself
1 she
1 sank
1 prone
1 upon
1 the
1 threshold
1 of
1 the
1 door
1 as
1 if
1 struck
1 down
1 by
1 death
1 Mercy
1 on
1 us
1 my
1 lady
1 are
1 you
1 ill
1 cried
1 Hester
1 the
1 maid
1 as
1 her
1 mistress
1 glided
1 into
1 the
1 room
1 looking
1 like
1 a
1 ghost
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 later
1 I
1 am
1 faint
1 and
1 cold
1 Help
1 me
1 to
1 my
1 bed
1 but
1 do
1 not
1 disturb
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 A
1 shiver
1 crept
1 over
1 her
1 as
1 she
1 spoke
1 and
1 casting
1 a
1 wild
1 woeful
1 look
1 about
1 her
1 she
1 laid
1 her
1 head
1 upon
1 the
1 pillow
1 like
1 one
1 who
1 never
1 cared
1 to
1 lift
1 it
1 up
1 again
1 Hester
1 a
1 sharp
1 -eyed
1 middle
1 -aged
1 woman
1 watched
1 the
1 pale
1 creature
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 then
1 left
1 the
1 room
1 muttering
1 Something
1 is
1 wrong
1 and
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 must
1 know
1 it
1 That
1 black
1 -bearded
1 man
1 came
1 for
1 no
1 good
1 I
1 ll
1 warrant
1 At
1 the
1 door
1 of
1 the
1 library
1 she
1 paused
1 No
1 sound
1 of
1 voices
1 came
1 from
1 within
1 a
1 stifled
1 groan
1 was
1 all
1 she
1 heard
1 and
1 without
1 waiting
1 to
1 knock
1 she
1 went
1 in
1 fearing
1 she
1 knew
1 not
1 what
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 sat
1 at
1 his
1 writing
1 table
1 pen
1 in
1 hand
1 but
1 his
1 face
1 was
1 hidden
1 on
1 his
1 arm
1 and
1 his
1 whole
1 attitude
1 betrayed
1 the
1 presence
1 of
1 some
1 overwhelming
1 despair
1 Please
1 sir
1 my
1 lady
1 is
1 ill
1 Shall
1 I
1 send
1 for
1 anyone
1 No
1 answer
1 Hester
1 repeated
1 her
1 words
1 but
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 never
1 stirred
1 Much
1 alarmed
1 the
1 woman
1 raised
1 his
1 head
1 saw
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 unconscious
1 and
1 rang
1 for
1 help
1 But
1 Richard
1 Trevlyn
1 was
1 past
1 help
1 though
1 he
1 lingered
1 for
1 some
1 hours
1 He
1 spoke
1 but
1 once
1 murmuring
1 faintly
1 ill
1 Alice
1 come
1 to
1 say
1 good
1 -bye
1 Bring
1 her
1 if
1 she
1 can

1 the

1 Hester
1 went
1 found
1 her
1 mistress
1 lying
1 as
1 she
1 left
1 her
1 like
1 a
1 figure
1 carved
1 in
1 stone
1 hen
1 she
1 gave
1 the
1 message
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 answered
1 sternly
1 Tell
1 him
1 I
1 will
1 not
1 come
1 and
1 turned
1 her
1 face
1 to
1 the
1 wall
1 with
1 an
1 expression
1 which
1 daunted
1 the
1 woman
1 too
1 much
1 for
1 another
1 word
1 Hester
1 whispered
1 the
1 hard
1 answer
1 to
1 the
1 physician
1 fearing
1 to
1 utter
1 it
1 aloud
1 but
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 heard
1 it
1 and
1 died
1 with
1 a
1 despairing
1 prayer
1 for
1 pardon
1 on
1 his
1 lips
1 hen
1 day
1 dawned
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 lay
1 in
1 his
1 shroud
1 and
1 his
1 little
1 daughter
1 in
1 her
1 cradle
1 the
1 one
1 unwept
1 the
1 other
1 unwelcomed
1 by
1 the
1 wife
1 and
1 mother
1 who
1 twelve
1 hours
1 before
1 had
1 called
1 herself
1 the
1 happiest
1 woman
1 in
1 England
1 They
1 thought
1 her
1 dying
1 and
1 at
1 her
1 own
1 command
1 gave
1 her
1 the
1 sealed
1 letter
1 bearing
1 her
1 address
1 which
1 her
1 husband
1 left
1 behind
1 him
1 She
1 read
1 it
1 laid
1 it
1 in
1 her
1 bosom
1 and
1 waking
1 from
1 the
1 trance
1 which
1 seemed
1 to
1 have
1 so
1 strongly
1 chilled
1 and
1 changed
1 her
1 besought
1 those
1 about
1 her
1 with
1 passionate
1 earnestness
1 to
1 save
1 her
1 life
1 For
1 two
1 days
1 she
1 hovered
1 on
1 the
1 brink
1 of
1 the
1 grave
1 and
1 nothing
1 but
1 the
1 indomitable
1 will
1 to
1 live
1 saved
1 her
1 the
1 doctors
1 said
1 On
1 the
1 third
1 day
1 she
1 rallied
1 wonderfully
1 and
1 some
1 purpose
1 seemed
1 to
1 gift
1 her
1 with
1 unnatural
1 strength
1 Evening
1 came
1 and
1 the
1 house
1 was
1 very
1 still
1 for
1 all
1 the
1 sad
1 bustle
1 of
1 preparation
1 for
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 funeral
1 was
1 over
1 and
1 he
1 lay
1 for
1 the
1 last
1 night
1 under
1 his
1 own
1 roof
1 Hester
1 sat
1 in
1 the
1 darkened
1 chamber
1 of
1 her
1 mistress
1 and
1 no
1 sound
1 broke
1 the
1 hush
1 but
1 the
1 low
1 lullaby
1 the
1 nurse
1 was
1 singing
1 to
1 the
1 fatherless
1 baby
1 in
1 the
1 adjoining
1 room
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 seemed
1 to
1 sleep
1 but
1 suddenly
1 put
1 back
1 the
1 curtain
1 saying
1 abruptly
1 here
1 does
1 he
1 lie
1 In
1 the
1 state
1 chamber
1 my
1 lady
1 replied
1 Hester
1 anxiously
1 watching
1 the
1 feverish
1 glitter
1 of
1 her
1 mistress
1 s
1 eye
1 the
1 flush
1 on
1 her
1 cheek
1 and
1 the
1 unnatural
1 calmness
1 of
1 her
1 manner
1 Help
1 me
1 to
1 go
1 there
1 I
1 must
1 see
1 him
1 It
1 would
1 be
1 your
1 death
1 my
1 lady
1 I
1 beseech
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 of
1 it
1 began
1 the
1 woman
1 but
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 seemed
1 not
1 to
1 hear
1 her
1 and
1 something
1 in
1 the
1 stern
1 pallor
1 of
1 her
1 face
1 awed
1 the
1 woman
1 into
1 submission
1 rapping
1 the
1 slight
1 form
1 of
1 her
1 mistress
1 in
1 a
1 warm
1 cloak
1 Hester
1 half
1 -led
1 half
1 -carried
1 her
1 to
1 the
1 state
1 room
1 and
1 left
1 her
1 on
1 the
1 threshold
1 I
1 must
1 go
1 in
1 alone
1 fear
1 nothing
1 but
1 wait
1 for
1 me
1 here
1 she
1 said
1 and
1 closed
1 the
1 door
1 behind
1 her
1 Five
1 minutes
1 had
1 not
1 elapsed
1 when
1 she
1 reappeared
1 with
1 no
1 sign
1 of
1 grief
1 on
1 her
1 rigid
1 face
1 Take
1 me
1 to
1 my
1 bed
1 and
1 bring
1 my
1 jewel
1 box
1 she
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 shuddering
1 sigh
1 as
1 the
1 faithful
1 servant
1 received
1 her
1 with
1 an
1 exclamation
1 of
1 thankfulness
1 hen
1 her
1 orders
1 had
1 been
1 obeyed
1 she
1 drew
1 from
1 her
1 bosom
1 the
1 portrait
1 of
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 which
1 she
1 always
1 wore
1 and
1 removing
1 the
1 ivory
1 oval
1 from
1 the
1 gold
1 case
1 she
1 locked
1 the
1 former
1 in
1 a
1 tiny
1 drawer
1 of
1 the
1 casket
1 replaced
1 the
1 empty
1 locket
1 in
1 her
1 breast
1 and
1 bade
1 Hester
1 give
1 the
1 jewels
1 to
1 atson
1 her
1 lawyer
1 who
1 would
1 see
1 them
1 put
1 in
1 a
1 safe
1 place
1 till
1 the
1 child
1 was
1 grown
1 Dear

1 was
1 all
1 the
1 answer
1 as
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 drew
1 the
1 curtains
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 shut

1 Sir

1 day
1 For
1 a
1 year
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 s

1 was
1 in

1 A
1 long
1 fever
1 left
1 her
1 so
1 weak
1 in
1 mind
1 and
1 body
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 little
1 hope
1 of
1 recovery
1 and
1 her
1 days
1 were
1 passed
1 in
1 a
1 state
1 of
1 apathy
1 sad
1 to
1 witness
1 She
1 seemed
1 to
1 have
1 forgotten
1 everything
1 even
1 the
1 shock
1 which
1 had
1 so
1 sorely
1 stricken
1 her
1 The
1 sight
1 of

1 to

1 her
1 and
1 month
1 after
1 month
1 slipped
1 by

1 no
1 trace
1 of

1 on
1 her

1 and

1 ho
1 the

1 The

1 There

1 the

1 Lillian
1 the

1 grew
1 from

1 childhood
1 in

1 of

1 Chapter
1 II
1 PAUL
1 Come
1 child
1 the
1 dew
1 is
1 falling
1 and
1 it
1 is
1 time
1 we
1 went
1 in
1 No
1 no
1 Mamma

1 yet
1 so
1 I
1 may

1 down
1 to
1 the

1 if
1 I
1 like
1 And
1 Lillian
1 as
1 willful
1 as
1 winsome
1 vanished
1 among
1 the
1 tall
1 ferns
1 where
1 deer
1 couched
1 and
1 rabbits
1 hid
1 Hester
1 leisurely
1 followed
1 looking
1 as
1 unchanged
1 as
1 if
1 a
1 day
1 instead
1 of
1 twelve
1 years
1 had
1 passed
1 since
1 her
1 arms
1 received
1 the
1 little
1 mistress
1 who
1 now
1 ruled
1 her
1 like
1 a
1 tyrant
1 She
1 had
1 taken
1 but
1 a
1 few
1 steps
1 when
1 the
1 child
1 came
1 flying
1 back
1 exclaiming
1 in
1 an
1 excited
1 tone
1 Oh
1 come
1 quick
1 There
1 s
1 a
1 man
1 there
1 a
1 dead
1 man
1 I
1 saw
1 him
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 frightened
1 Nonsense
1 child
1 it
1 s
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 keepers
1 asleep
1 or

1 stroller
1 who
1 has
1 no

1 here
1 Take
1 my
1 hand
1 and
1 we
1 ll
1 see
1 who
1 it
1 is
1 Somewhat
1 reassured
1 Lillian
1 led
1 her
1 nurse
1 to
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 old
1 oaks
1 beside
1 the
1 path
1 and
1 pointed
1 to
1 a
1 figure
1 lying
1 half
1 hidden
1 in
1 the
1 fern
1 A
1 slender
1 swarthy
1 boy
1 of
1 sixteen
1 with
1 curly
1 black
1 hair
1 dark
1 brows
1 and
1 thick
1 lashes
1 a
1 singularly
1 stern
1 mouth
1 and
1 a
1 general
1 expression
1 of
1 strength
1 and
1 pride
1 which
1 added
1 character
1 to
1 his
1 boyish
1 face
1 and
1 dignified
1 his
1 poverty
1 His
1 dress
1 betrayed
1 that
1 being
1 dusty
1 and
1 threadbare
1 his
1 shoes
1 much
1 worn
1 and
1 his
1 possessions
1 contained
1 in
1 the
1 little
1 bundle
1 on
1 which
1 he
1 pillowed
1 his
1 head
1 He
1 was
1 sleeping
1 like
1 one
1 quite
1 spent
1 with
1 weariness
1 and
1 never
1 stirred
1 though
1 Hester
1 bent
1 away
1 the
1 ferns
1 and
1 examined
1 him
1 closely
1 He
1 s
1 not
1 dead
1 my
1 deary
1 he
1 s
1 asleep
1 poor
1 lad
1 worn
1 out
1 with
1 his
1 day
1 s
1 tramp
1 I
1 dare
1 say
1 I
1 m
1 glad
1 he
1 s
1 alive
1 and
1 I
1 wish
1 he
1 d
1 wake
1 up
1 He
1 s
1 a
1 pretty
1 boy
1 isn
1 t
1 he
1 See
1 what
1 nice
1 hands
1 he
1 s
1 got
1 and
1 his
1 hair
1 is
1 more
1 curly
1 than
1 mine
1 Make
1 him
1 open
1 his
1 eyes
1 Hester
1 commanded
1 the
1 little
1 lady
1 whose
1 fear
1 had
1 given
1 place
1 to
1 interest
1 Hush
1 he
1 s
1 stirring
1 I
1 wonder
1 how
1 he
1 got
1 in
1 and
1 what
1 he
1 wants
1 whispered
1 Hester
1 I
1 ll
1 ask
1 him
1 and
1 before
1 her
1 nurse
1 could
1 arrest
1 her
1 Lillian
1 drew
1 a
1 tall
1 fern
1 softly
1 over
1 the
1 sleeper
1 s
1 face
1 laughing
1 aloud
1 as
1 she
1 did
1 so
1 The
1 boy
1 woke
1 at
1 the
1 sound
1 and
1 without
1 stirring
1 lay
1 looking
1 up
1 at
1 the
1 lovely
1 little
1 face
1 bent
1 over
1 him
1 as
1 if
1 still
1 in
1 a
1 dream
1 Bella
1 cara
1 he
1 said
1 in
1 a
1 musical
1 voice
1 Then
1 as
1 the
1 child
1 drew
1 back
1 abashed
1 at
1 the
1 glance
1 of
1 his
1 large
1 bright
1 eyes
1 he
1 seemed
1 to
1 wake
1 entirely
1 and
1 springing
1 to
1 his
1 feet
1 looked
1 at
1 Hester
1 with
1 a
1 quick
1 searching
1 glance
1 Something
1 in
1 his
1 face
1 and
1 air
1 caused
1 the
1 woman
1 to
1 soften
1 her
1 tone
1 a
1 little
1 as
1 she
1 said
1 gravely
1 Did
1 you
1 wish
1 to
1 see
1 any
1 one
1 at
1 the
1 Hall
1 Yes
1 Is
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 here
1 was
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 answer
1 as
1 he
1 stood
1 cap
1 in
1 hand
1 with
1 the
1 smile
1 fading
1 already
1 from
1 his
1 face
1 She
1 is
1 but
1 unless
1 your
1 business
1 is
1 very
1 urgent
1 you
1 had
1 better
1 see
1 Parks
1 the
1 keeper
1 we
1 don

1 my
1 lady
1 with
1 trifles
1 I
1 ve
1 a
1 note
1 for
1 her
1 from
1 Colonel
1 Daventry
1 and
1 as
1 it
1 is
1 not
1 a
1 trifle
1 I
1 ll
1 deliver
1 it
1 myself
1 if
1 you
1 please
1 Hester
1 hesitated
1 an
1 instant
1 but
1 Lillian
1 cried
1 out
1 Mamma
1 is
1 close
1 by
1 come
1 and
1 see
1 her
1 and
1 led
1 the
1 way
1 beckoning
1 as
1 she
1 ran
1 The
1 lad
1 followed
1 with
1 a
1 composed
1 air
1 and
1 Hester
1 brought
1 up
1 the
1 rear
1 taking
1 notes
1 as
1 she
1 went
1 with
1 a
1 woman
1 s
1 keen
1 eye
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 a
1 beautiful
1 pale
1 woman
1 delicate
1 in
1 health
1 and
1 melancholy
1 in
1 spirit
1 sat
1 on
1 a
1 rustic
1 seat
1 with
1 a
1 book
1 in
1 her
1 hand
1 not
1 reading
1 but
1 musing
1 with
1 an
1 absent
1 mind
1 As
1 the
1 child
1 approached
1 she
1 held
1 out
1 her
1 hand
1 to
1 welcome
1 her
1 but
1 neither
1 smiled
1 nor
1 spoke
1 Mamma
1 here

1 -a
1 person
1 to

1 you
1 cried
1 Lillian
1 rather
1 at
1 a
1 loss
1 how
1 to
1 designate
1 the
1 stranger
1 whose

1 and
1 gravity
1 now
1 awed
1 her
1 A
1 note
1 from
1 Colonel
1 Daventry
1 my
1 lady
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 bow
1 the
1 boy
1 delivered
1 the
1 missive
1 Scarcely
1 glancing
1 at
1 him
1 she
1 opened
1 it
1 and
1 read
1 My

1 brought

1 but
1 he
1 is

1 The

1 smiled
1 showing
1 a

1 set
1 of
1 teeth

1 As

1 spoke
1 without

1 full

1 The
1 tone
1 half
1 modest
1 half
1 eager
1 in

1 the
1 boy
1 spoke
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 the

1 list
1 of

1 brought

1 The

1 from

1 I

1 and

1 the

1 looked
1 away
1 from

1 before

1 and
1 a

1 flush
1 of

1 crossed
1 his

1 cheek
1 Hester
1 saw
1 it
1 and
1 said
1 within

1 That
1 boy
1 has
1 good

1 in

1 He
1 s
1 no

1 Poor

1 it

1 for

1 for

1 gesture
1 and
1 led

1 SECRET
1 SERVICE
1 In
1 a
1 week
1 Paul
1 was
1 a
1 favorite
1 with
1 the
1 household
1 even
1 prudent
1 Hester
1 felt
1 the
1 charm
1 of
1 his
1 presence
1 and
1 owned
1 that
1 Lillian
1 was
1 happier
1 for
1 a
1 young
1 companion
1 in
1 her
1 walks
1 Hitherto
1 the
1 child
1 had
1 led
1 a
1 solitary
1 life
1 with
1 no
1 playmates
1 of
1 her
1 own
1 age
1 such
1 being
1 the
1 will
1 of
1 my
1 lady
1 therefore
1 she
1 welcomed
1 Paul
1 as
1 a
1 new
1 and
1 delightful
1 amusement
1 considering
1 him
1 her
1 private
1 property
1 and
1 soon
1 transferring

1 duties
1 from
1 the
1 garden
1 to
1 the
1 house
1 Satisfied
1 of
1 his
1 merits
1 my
1 lady
1 yielded
1 to
1 Lillian
1 s
1 demands
1 and
1 Paul
1 was
1 installed
1 as
1 page
1 to
1 the
1 young
1 lady
1 Always
1 respectful
1 and
1 obedient
1 he
1 never
1 forgot
1 his
1 place
1 yet
1 seemed
1 unconsciously
1 to
1 influence
1 all
1 who
1 approached
1 him
1 and
1 win
1 the
1 goodwill
1 of
1 everyone
1 My
1 lady
1 showed
1 unusual
1 interest
1 in
1 the
1 lad
1 and
1 Lillian
1 openly
1 displayed
1 her
1 admiration
1 for
1 his
1 accomplishments
1 and
1 her
1 affection
1 for
1 her
1 devoted
1 young
1 servitor
1 Hester
1 was
1 much
1 flattered
1 by
1 the
1 confidence
1 he
1 reposed
1 in
1 her
1 for
1 to
1 her
1 alone
1 did
1 he
1 tell
1 his
1 story
1 and
1 of
1 her
1 alone
1 asked
1 advice
1 and
1 comfort
1 in
1 his
1 various
1 small
1 straits
1 It
1 was
1 as
1 she
1 suspected
1 Paul
1 was
1 a
1 gentleman
1 s
1 son
1 but
1 misfortune
1 had
1 robbed
1 him
1 of
1 home
1 friends
1 and
1 parents
1 and
1 thrown
1 him
1 upon
1 the
1 world
1 to
1 shift
1 for
1 himself
1 This
1 sad
1 story
1 touched
1 the
1 woman
1 s
1 heart
1 and
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 manly
1 spirit
1 won
1 respect
1 She
1 had
1 lost
1 a
1 son
1 years
1 ago
1 and
1 her
1 empty
1 heart
1 yearned
1 over

1 lad
1 Ashamed
1 to
1 confess
1 the
1 tender
1 feeling
1 she
1 wore
1 her
1 usual
1 severe
1 manner
1 to
1 him
1 in

1 but
1 in
1 private
1 softened
1 wonderfully
1 and
1 enjoyed

1 heartily
1 Paul
1 come
1 in
1 I
1 want
1 to

1 with
1 you
1 a
1 moment
1 said
1 my
1 lady
1 from
1 the
1 long
1 window
1 of
1 the
1 library
1 to
1 the
1 boy
1 who
1 was
1 training
1 vines
1 outside
1 Dropping
1 his
1 tools
1 and
1 pulling
1 off
1 his
1 hat
1 Paul
1 obeyed
1 looking
1 a
1 little
1 anxious
1 for
1 the
1 month
1 of
1 trial
1 expired
1 that
1 day
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 saw
1 and
1 answered
1 the
1 look
1 with
1 a

1 smile

1 You

1 and
1 I
1 am
1 satisfied
1 with
1 you
1 Thank
1 you
1 my
1 lady
1 And
1 an
1 odd
1 glance
1 of
1 mingled
1 pride
1 and
1 pain
1 shone
1 in
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 downcast
1 eyes
1 That
1 is
1 settled
1 then
1 Now
1 let
1 me
1 say
1 what
1 I
1 called
1 you
1 in
1 for
1 You
1 spoke
1 of
1 being
1 able
1 to
1 illuminate
1 on

1 Can
1 you
1 restore
1 this
1 old
1 book
1 for

1 She
1 put
1 into
1 his
1 hand
1 the
1 ancient
1 volume
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 had
1 been
1 reading
1 the
1 day

1 It
1 had
1 lain
1 neglected
1 in
1 a
1 damp
1 nook
1 for
1 years
1 till
1 my
1 lady
1 discovered
1 it
1 and
1 sad
1 as
1 were
1 the
1 associations
1 connected
1 with
1 it
1 she
1 desired
1 to
1 preserve
1 it
1 for
1 the
1 sake

1 it

1 opened
1 at
1 the

1 oftenest
1 read
1 by
1 its
1 late
1 master
1 His
1 eye
1 kindled
1 as
1 he
1 looked
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 quick
1 gesture
1 he
1 turned
1 as
1 if
1 toward
1 the
1 light
1 in
1 truth
1 to
1 hide
1 the
1 flash
1 of
1 triumph
1 that
1 passed
1 across

1 moment
1 as
1 he
1 looked
1 up
1 quite
1 composed
1 Yes
1 my
1 lady
1 I
1 can
1 retouch
1 the

1 I
1 like
1 the

1 gladly

1 if

1 Do
1 it

1 How
1 so
1 she
1 asked
1 surprised
1 Paul
1 had
1 spoken
1 hastily
1 and
1 for
1 an
1 instant
1 looked
1 embarrassed
1 but
1 answered
1 with
1 a
1 sudden
1 flush
1 on
1 his
1 dark
1 cheeks
1 You
1 have
1 been
1 kind
1 to
1 me
1 and
1 I

1 smile
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 left

1 to
1 begin

1 work
1 The
1 moment
1 the

1 closed
1 behind
1 her
1 a
1 total
1 change
1 passed
1 over
1 Paul
1 He
1 shook
1 his
1 clenched
1 hand
1 after
1 her
1 with
1 a
1 gesture
1 of
1 menace
1 then
1 tossed
1 up
1 the
1 old
1 book
1 and
1 caught
1 it
1 with
1 an
1 exclamation
1 of
1 delight
1 as
1 he
1 reopened
1 it
1 at

1 of

1 he
1 muttered
1 hat

1 that
1 you
1 ll

1 said
1 a

1 behind
1 him
1 I
1 ll
1 keep
1 my
1 word
1 to
1 my
1 lady
1 and
1 do
1 my
1 best
1 to
1 restore
1 this
1 book
1 Mrs
1 Hester
1 he
1 answered
1 quickly
1 recovering
1 himself
1 Ah
1 that
1 s
1 the
1 last
1 book
1 poor
1 Master
1 read
1 I
1 hid
1 it
1 away
1 but
1 my
1 lady
1 found
1 it
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 me
1 said
1 Hester
1 with
1 a
1 doleful
1 sigh
1 Did
1 he
1 die
1 suddenly
1 then
1 asked
1 the
1 boy
1 Dear
1 heart
1 yes
1 I
1 found
1 him
1 dying
1 in
1 this
1 room
1 with
1 the
1 ink
1 scarce
1 dry
1 on
1 the
1 letter
1 he
1 left
1 for
1 my
1 lady
1 A
1 mysterious
1 business
1 and
1 a
1 sad
1 one
1 Tell
1 me
1 about
1 it
1 I
1 like
1 sad
1 stories
1 and
1 I
1 already
1 feel
1 as
1 if
1 I
1 belonged
1 to
1 the
1 family
1 a
1 loyal
1 retainer
1 as
1 in
1 the
1 old
1 times
1 hile
1 you
1 dust
1 the
1 books
1 and
1 I
1 rub
1 the
1 mold
1 off
1 this
1 old
1 cover
1 tell
1 me
1 the
1 tale
1 please
1 Mrs
1 Hester
1 She
1 shook
1 her
1 head
1 but
1 yielded
1 to
1 the
1 persuasive
1 look
1 and
1 tone
1 of
1 the
1 boy
1 telling
1 the
1 story
1 more
1 fully
1 than
1 she
1 intended
1 for
1 she
1 loved
1 talking
1 and
1 had
1 come
1 to
1 regard
1 Paul
1 as
1 her
1 own
1 almost
1 And
1 the
1 letter
1 hat
1 was
1 in
1 it
1 asked
1 the
1 boy
1 as
1 she
1 paused
1 at
1 the
1 catastrophe
1 No
1 one
1 ever
1 knew
1 but
1 my
1 lady
1 She
1 destroyed
1 it
1 then
1 I
1 thought
1 so
1 till
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 afterward
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 lawyers
1 came
1 pestering
1 me
1 with
1 questions
1 and
1 made
1 me
1 ask
1 her
1 She
1 was
1 ill
1 at
1 the
1 time
1 but
1 answered
1 with
1 a
1 look
1 I
1 shall
1 never
1 forget
1 No
1 it
1 s
1 not
1 burnt
1 but
1 no
1 one
1 shall
1 ever
1 see
1 it
1 I
1 dared
1 ask
1 no
1 more
1 but
1 I
1 fancy
1 she
1 has
1 it
1 safe
1 somewhere
1 and
1 if
1 it
1 s
1 ever
1 needed
1 she
1 ll
1 bring
1 it
1 out
1 It
1 was
1 only
1 some
1 private
1 matters
1 I
1 fancy
1 And
1 the
1 stranger
1 Oh
1 he
1 vanished
1 as
1 oddly
1 as
1 he
1 came
1 and
1 has
1 never
1 been
1 found
1 A
1 strange
1 story
1 lad
1 Keep
1 silent
1 and
1 let
1 it
1 rest
1 No
1 fear
1 of
1 my
1 tattling
1 and
1 the
1 boy
1 smiled
1 curiously
1 to
1 himself
1 as
1 he
1 bent
1 over
1 the
1 book
1 polishing
1 the
1 brassbound
1 cover
1 hat
1 are
1 you
1 doing
1 with
1 that
1 pretty
1 white
1 wax
1 asked
1 Lillian
1 the
1 next
1 day
1 as
1 she
1 came
1 upon
1 Paul
1 in
1 a
1 quiet
1 corner
1 of
1 the
1 garden
1 and
1 found
1 him
1 absorbed
1 in
1 some
1 mysterious
1 occupation
1 ith
1 a
1 quick
1 gesture
1 he
1 destroyed
1 his
1 work
1 and
1 banishing
1 a
1 momentary
1 expression
1 of
1 annoyance
1 he
1 answered
1 in
1 his
1 accustomed
1 tone
1 as
1 he
1 began
1 to
1 work
1 anew
1 I
1 am
1 molding
1 a
1 little
1 deer
1 for
1 you
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 See
1 here
1 is
1 a
1 rabbit
1 already
1 done
1 and
1 I
1 ll
1 soon
1 have
1 a
1 stag
1 also
1 It
1 s
1 very
1 pretty
1 How
1 many
1 nice
1 things
1 you
1 can
1 do
1 and
1 how
1 kind
1 you
1 are
1 to
1 think
1 of
1 my
1 liking
1 something
1 new
1 as
1 this
1 wax
1 what
1 you
1 went
1 to
1 get
1 this
1 morning
1 when
1 you
1 rode
1 away
1 so
1 early
1 asked
1 the
1 child
1 Yes
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 I
1 was
1 ordered
1 to
1 exercise
1 your
1 pony
1 and
1 I
1 made
1 him
1 useful
1 as
1 well
1 ould
1 you
1 like
1 to
1 try
1 this
1 It
1 s
1 very
1 easy
1 Lillian
1 was
1 charmed
1 and
1 for
1 several
1 days
1 wax
1 modeling
1 was
1 her
1 favorite
1 play
1 Then
1 she
1 tired
1 of
1 it
1 and
1 Paul
1 invented
1 a
1 new
1 amusement
1 smiling
1 his
1 inexplicable
1 smile
1 as
1 he
1 threw
1 away
1 the
1 broken
1 toys
1 of
1 wax
1 You
1 are
1 getting
1 pale
1 and
1 thin
1 keeping
1 such
1 late
1 hours
1 Paul
1 Go
1 to
1 bed
1 boy
1 go
1 to
1 bed
1 and
1 get
1 your
1 sleep
1 early
1 said
1 Hester
1 a
1 week
1 afterward
1 with
1 a
1 motherly
1 air
1 as
1 Paul
1 passed
1 her
1 one
1 morning
1 And
1 how
1 do
1 you
1 know
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 go
1 to
1 bed
1 he
1 asked
1 wheeling
1 about
1 My
1 lady
1 has
1 been
1 restless
1 lately
1 and
1 I
1 sit
1 up
1 with
1 her
1 till
1 she
1 sleeps
1 As
1 I
1 go
1 to
1 my
1 room
1 I
1 see
1 your
1 lamp
1 burning
1 and
1 last
1 night
1 I
1 got
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 your
1 door
1 meaning
1 to
1 speak
1 to
1 you
1 but
1 didn
1 t
1 thinking
1 you
1 d
1 take
1 it
1 amiss
1 But
1 really
1 you
1 are
1 the
1 worse
1 for
1 late
1 hours
1 child
1 I
1 shall
1 soon
1 finish
1 restoring
1 the
1 book
1 and
1 then
1 I
1 ll
1 sleep
1 I
1 hope
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 disturb
1 you
1 I
1 have
1 to
1 grind
1 my
1 colors
1 and
1 often
1 make
1 more
1 noise
1 than
1 I
1 mean
1 to
1 Paul
1 fixed
1 his
1 eyes
1 sharply
1 on
1 the
1 woman
1 as
1 he
1 spoke
1 but
1 she
1 seemed
1 unconscious
1 of
1 it
1 and
1 turned
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 saying
1 indifferently
1 Oh
1 that
1 s
1 the
1 odd
1 sound
1 is
1 it
1 No
1 it
1 doesn
1 t
1 trouble
1 me
1 so
1 grind
1 away
1 and
1 make
1 an
1 end
1 of
1 it
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 may
1 be
1 An
1 anxious
1 fold
1 in
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 forehead
1 smoothed
1 itself
1 away
1 as
1 he
1 left
1 her
1 saying
1 to
1 himself
1 with
1 a
1 sigh
1 of
1 relief
1 A
1 narrow
1 escape
1 it
1 s
1 well
1 I
1 keep
1 the
1 door
1 locked
1 The
1 boy
1 s
1 light
1 burned
1 no
1 more
1 after
1 that
1 and
1 Hester
1 was
1 content
1 till
1 a
1 new
1 worry
1 came
1 to
1 trouble
1 her
1 On
1 her
1 way
1 to
1 her
1 room
1 late
1 one
1 night
1 she
1 saw
1 a
1 tall
1 shadow
1 flit
1 down
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 side
1 corridors
1 that
1 branched
1 from
1 the
1 main
1 one
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 she
1 was
1 startled
1 but
1 being
1 a
1 woman
1 of
1 courage
1 she
1 followed
1 noiselessly
1 till
1 the
1 shadow
1 seemed
1 to
1 vanish
1 in
1 the
1 gloom
1 of
1 the
1 great
1 hall
1 If
1 the
1 house
1 ever
1 owned
1 a
1 ghost
1 I
1 d
1 say
1 that
1 s
1 it
1 but
1 it
1 never
1 did
1 so
1 I
1 suspect
1 some
1 deviltry
1 I
1 ll
1 step
1 to
1 Paul
1 He
1 s
1 not
1 asleep
1 I
1 dare
1 say
1 He
1 s
1 a
1 brave
1 and
1 a
1 sensible
1 lad
1 and
1 with
1 him
1 I
1 ll
1 quietly
1 search
1 the
1 house
1 Away
1 she
1 went
1 more
1 nervous
1 than
1 she
1 would
1 own
1 and
1 tapped
1 at
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 door
1 No
1 one
1 answered
1 and
1 seeing
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 ajar
1 Hester
1 whisked
1 in
1 so
1 hurriedly
1 that
1 her
1 candle
1 went
1 out
1 ith
1 an
1 impatient
1 exclamation
1 at
1 her
1 carelessness
1 she
1 glided
1 to
1 the
1 bed
1 drew
1 the
1 curtain
1 and
1 put
1 forth
1 her
1 hand
1 to
1 touch
1 the
1 sleeper
1 The
1 bed
1 was
1 empty
1 A
1 disagreeable
1 thrill
1 shot
1 through
1 her
1 as
1 she
1 assured
1 herself
1 of
1 the
1 fact
1 by
1 groping
1 along
1 the
1 narrow
1 bed
1 Standing
1 in
1 the
1 shadow
1 of
1 the
1 curtain
1 she
1 stared
1 about
1 the
1 dusky
1 room
1 in
1 which
1 objects
1 were
1 visible
1 by
1 the
1 light
1 of
1 a
1 new
1 moon
1 Lord
1 bless
1 me
1 what
1 is
1 the
1 boy
1 about
1 I
1 do
1 believe
1 it
1 was
1 him
1 I
1 saw
1 in
1 the
1 -
1 -
1 She
1 got
1 no
1 further
1 in
1 her
1 mental
1 exclamation
1 for
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 light
1 approaching
1 footsteps
1 neared
1 her
1 Slipping
1 around
1 the
1 bed
1 she
1 waited
1 in
1 the
1 shadow
1 and
1 a
1 moment
1 after
1 Paul
1 appeared
1 looking
1 pale
1 and
1 ghostly
1 with
1 dark
1 disheveled
1 hair
1 wide
1 -open
1 eyes
1 and
1 a
1 cloak
1 thrown
1 over
1 his
1 shoulders
1 ithout
1 a
1 pause
1 he
1 flung
1 it
1 off
1 laid
1 himself
1 in
1 bed
1 and
1 seemed
1 to
1 sleep
1 at
1 once
1 Paul
1 Paul
1 whispered
1 Hester
1 shaking
1 him
1 after
1 a
1 pause
1 of
1 astonishment
1 at
1 the
1 whole
1 proceeding
1 Hey
1 what
1 is
1 it
1 And
1 he
1 sat
1 up
1 looking
1 drowsily
1 about
1 him
1 Come
1 come
1 no
1 tricks
1 boy
1 hat
1 are
1 you
1 doing
1 trailing
1 about

1 at
1 this
1 hour
1 and
1 in
1 such
1 trim
1 hy
1 Hester
1 is
1 it
1 you
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 with
1 a
1 laugh
1 as
1 he
1 shook
1 off
1 her
1 grip
1 and
1 looked
1 up
1 at
1 her
1 in
1 surprise
1 Yes
1 and
1 well
1 it
1 is
1 me
1 If
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 any
1 of
1 those
1 silly
1 girls
1 the
1 house
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 roused
1 by
1 this
1 time

1 afoot
1 that

1 fashion
1 Leave

1 might
1 these
1 two
1 hours

1 do
1 you
1 mean
1 Hester
1 She
1 told
1 him
1 as
1 she
1 relit
1 her
1 lamp
1 and
1 stood
1 eyeing
1 him
1 sharply
1 the
1 while
1 hen
1 she
1 finished
1 he
1 was
1 silent
1 a
1 minute
1 then
1 said
1 looking
1 half
1 vexed
1 and
1 half
1 ashamed
1 I
1 see
1 how
1 it
1 is
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 glad
1 you
1 alone

1 He
1 held
1 out
1 his
1 hand
1 with
1 the
1 look
1 that
1 was
1 irresistible
1 to
1 Hester
1 Remembering

1 that

1 boy
1 she
1 stroked
1 the

1 Chapter

1 VANISHED
1 He
1 s
1 a
1 handsome
1 lad
1 and
1 one
1 any
1 woman
1 might
1 be
1 proud
1 to
1 call
1 her
1 son
1 said
1 Hester
1 to
1 Bedford
1 the
1 stately
1 butler
1 as
1 they
1 lingered
1 at
1 the
1 hall
1 door
1 one
1 autumn
1 morning
1 to
1 watch
1 their
1 young
1 lady
1 s
1 departure
1 on
1 her
1 daily
1 ride
1 You
1 are
1 right
1 Mrs
1 Hester
1 he
1 s
1 a
1 fine
1 lad
1 and
1 yet
1 he
1 seems
1 above
1 his
1 place
1 though
1 he
1 does
1 look
1 the
1 very
1 picture
1 of
1 a
1 lady
1 s
1 groom
1 replied
1 Bedford
1 approvingly
1 So
1 he
1 did
1 as
1 he
1 stood
1 holding
1 the
1 white
1 pony
1 of
1 his
1 little
1 mistress
1 for
1 the
1 boy
1 gave
1 an
1 air
1 to
1 whatever
1 he
1 wore
1 and
1 looked
1 like
1 a
1 gentleman
1 even
1 in
1 his
1 livery
1 The
1 dark
1 -blue
1 coat
1 with
1 silver
1 buttons
1 the
1 silver
1 band
1 about
1 his
1 hat
1 his
1 white
1 -topped
1 boots
1 and
1 bright
1 spurs
1 spotless
1 gloves
1 and
1 tightly
1 drawn
1 belt
1 were
1 all
1 in
1 perfect
1 order
1 all
1 becoming
1 and
1 his
1 handsome
1 dark
1 face
1 caused
1 many
1 a
1 susceptible
1 maid
1 to
1 blush
1 and
1 simper
1 as
1 they
1 passed
1 him
1 Gentleman
1 Paul
1 as
1 the
1 servants
1 called
1 him
1 was
1 rather
1 lofty
1 and
1 reserved
1 among
1 his
1 mates
1 but
1 they
1 liked
1 him
1 nonetheless
1 for
1 Hester
1 had
1 dropped
1 hints
1 of
1 his
1 story
1 and
1 quite
1 a
1 little
1 romance
1 had
1 sprung
1 up
1 about
1 him
1 He
1 stood
1 leaning
1 against
1 the
1 docile
1 creature
1 sunk
1 in
1 thought
1 and
1 quite
1 unconscious
1 of
1 the
1 watchers
1 and
1 whisperers
1 close
1 by
1 But
1 as
1 Lillian
1 appeared
1 he
1 woke
1 up
1 attended
1 to
1 his
1 duties
1 like
1 a
1 well
1 -trained
1 groom
1 and
1 lingered
1 over
1 his
1 task
1 as
1 if
1 he
1 liked
1 it
1 Down
1 the
1 avenue
1 he
1 rode
1 behind
1 her
1 but
1 as
1 they
1 turned
1 into
1 a
1 shady
1 lane
1 Lillian
1 beckoned
1 saying
1 in
1 the
1 imperious
1 tone
1 habitual
1 to
1 her
1 Ride
1 near
1 me
1 I
1 wish
1 to
1 talk
1 Paul
1 obeyed
1 and
1 amused
1 her
1 with
1 the
1 chat
1 she
1 liked
1 till
1 they
1 reached
1 a
1 hazel
1 copse
1 here
1 he
1 drew
1 rein
1 and
1 leaping
1 down
1 gathered
1 a
1 handful
1 of
1 ripe
1 nuts
1 for
1 her
1 How
1 nice
1 Let
1 us
1 rest
1 a
1 minute
1 here
1 and
1 while
1 I
1 eat
1 a
1 few
1 please
1 pull
1 some
1 of
1 those
1 flowers
1 for
1 Mamma
1 She
1 likes
1 a
1 wild
1 nosegay
1 better
1 than
1 any
1 I
1 can
1 bring
1 her
1 from
1 the
1 garden
1 Lillian
1 ate
1 her
1 nuts
1 till
1 Paul
1 came
1 to
1 her
1 with
1 a
1 hatful
1 of
1 late
1 flowers
1 and
1 standing
1 by
1 her
1 held
1 the
1 impromptu
1 basket
1 while
1 she
1 made
1 up
1 a
1 bouquet
1 to
1 suit
1 her
1 taste
1 You
1 shall
1 have
1 a
1 posy
1 too
1 I
1 like
1 you
1 to
1 wear
1 one
1 in
1 your
1 buttonhole
1 as
1 the
1 ladies
1 grooms
1 do
1 in
1 the
1 Park
1 said
1 the
1 child
1 settling
1 a
1 scarlet
1 poppy
1 in
1 the
1 blue
1 coat
1 Thanks
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 I
1 ll
1 wear
1 your
1 colors
1 with
1 all
1 my
1 heart
1 especially
1 today
1 for
1 it
1 is
1 my
1 birthday
1 And
1 Paul
1 looked
1 up
1 at
1 the
1 blooming
1 little
1 face
1 with
1 unusual
1 softness
1 in
1 his
1 keen
1 blue
1 eyes
1 Is
1 it
1 hy
1 then
1 you
1 re
1 seventeen
1 almost
1 a
1 man
1 aren
1 t
1 you
1 Yes
1 thank
1 heaven
1 muttered
1 the
1 boy
1 half
1 to
1 himself
1 I
1 wish
1 I
1 was
1 as
1 old
1 I
1 shan
1 t
1 be
1 in
1 my
1 teens
1 till
1 autumn
1 I
1 must
1 give
1 you
1 something
1 Paul
1 because
1 I
1 like
1 you
1 very
1 much
1 and
1 you
1 are
1 always
1 doing
1 kind
1 things
1 for
1 me
1 hat
1 shall
1 it
1 be
1 And
1 the
1 child
1 held
1 out
1 her
1 hand
1 with
1 a
1 cordial
1 look
1 and
1 gesture
1 that
1 touched
1 the
1 boy
1 ith
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 foreign
1 fashions
1 which
1 sometimes
1 appeared
1 when
1 he
1 forgot
1 himself
1 he
1 kissed
1 the
1 small
1 hand
1 saying
1 impulsively
1 My
1 dear
1 little
1 mistress
1 I
1 want
1 nothing
1 but
1 your
1 goodwill
1 -
1 -and
1 your
1 forgiveness
1 he
1 added
1 under
1 his
1 breath
1 You
1 have
1 that
1 already
1 Paul
1 and
1 I
1 shall
1 find
1 something
1 to
1 add
1 to
1 it
1 But
1 what
1 is
1 that
1 And
1 she
1 laid
1 hold
1 of
1 a
1 little
1 locket
1 which
1 had
1 slipped
1 into
1 sight
1 as
1 Paul
1 bent
1 forward
1 in
1 his
1 salute
1 He
1 thrust
1 it
1 back
1 coloring
1 so
1 deeply
1 that
1 the
1 child
1 observed
1 it
1 and
1 exclaimed
1 with
1 a
1 mischievous
1 laugh
1 It
1 is
1 your
1 sweetheart
1 Paul
1 I
1 heard
1 Bessy
1 my
1 maid
1 tell
1 Hester
1 she
1 was
1 sure
1 you
1 had
1 one
1 because
1 you
1 took
1 no
1 notice
1 of
1 them
1 Let
1 me
1 see
1 it
1 Is
1 she
1 pretty
1 Very
1 pretty
1 answered
1 the
1 boy
1 without
1 showing
1 the
1 picture
1 Do
1 you
1 like
1 her
1 very
1 much
1 questioned
1 Lillian
1 getting
1 interested
1 in
1 the
1 little
1 romance
1 Very
1 much
1 and
1 Paul
1 s
1 black
1 eyelashes
1 fell
1 ould
1 you
1 die
1 for
1 her
1 as
1 they
1 say
1 in
1 the
1 old
1 songs
1 asked
1 the
1 girl
1 melodramatically
1 Yes
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 or
1 live
1 for
1 her
1 which
1 is
1 harder
1 Dear
1 me
1 how
1 very
1 nice
1 it
1 must
1 be
1 to
1 have
1 anyone
1 care
1 for
1 one
1 so
1 much
1 said
1 the
1 child
1 innocently
1 I
1 wonder
1 if
1 anybody
1 ever
1 will
1 for
1 me
1 Love
1 comes
1 to
1 all
1 soon
1 or
1 late
1 And
1 maketh
1 gay
1 or
1 sad
1 For
1 every
1 bird
1 will
1 find
1 its
1 mate
1 And
1 every
1 lass
1 a
1 lad
1 sang
1 Paul
1 quoting
1 one
1 of
1 Hester
1 s
1 songs
1 and
1 looking
1 relieved
1 that
1 Lillian
1 s
1 thoughts
1 had
1 strayed
1 from
1 him
1 But
1 he
1 was
1 mistaken
1 Shall
1 you
1 marry
1 this
1 sweetheart
1 of
1 yours
1 someday
1 asked
1 Lillian
1 turning
1 to
1 him
1 with
1 a
1 curious
1 yet
1 wistful
1 look
1 Perhaps
1 You
1 look
1 as
1 if
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 perhaps
1 about
1 it
1 said
1 the
1 child
1 quick
1 to
1 read
1 the
1 kindling
1 of
1 the
1 eye
1 and
1 the
1 change
1 in
1 the
1 voice
1 that
1 accompanied
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 reply
1 She
1 is
1 very
1 young
1 and
1 I
1 must
1 wait
1 and
1 while
1 I
1 wait
1 many
1 things
1 may
1 happen
1 to
1 part
1 us
1 Is
1 she
1 a
1 lady
1 Yes
1 a
1 wellborn
1 lovely
1 little
1 lady
1 and
1 I
1 ll
1 marry
1 her
1 if
1 I
1 live
1 Paul
1 spoke
1 with
1 a
1 look
1 of
1 decision
1 and
1 a
1 proud
1 lift
1 of
1 the
1 head
1 that
1 contrasted
1 curiously
1 with
1 the
1 badge
1 of
1 servitude
1 he
1 wore
1 Lillian
1 felt
1 this
1 and
1 asked
1 with
1 a
1 sudden
1 shyness
1 coming
1 over
1 her
1 But
1 you
1 are
1 a
1 gentleman
1 and
1 so
1 no
1 one
1 will
1 mind
1 even
1 if
1 you
1 are
1 not
1 rich
1 How
1 do
1 you
1 know
1 what
1 I
1 am
1 he
1 asked
1 quickly
1 I
1 heard
1 Hester
1 tell
1 the
1 housekeeper
1 that
1 you
1 were
1 not
1 what
1 you
1 seemed
1 and
1 one
1 day
1 she
1 hoped
1 you
1 d
1 get
1 your
1 right
1 place
1 again
1 I
1 asked
1 Mamma
1 about
1 it
1 and
1 she
1 said
1 she
1 would
1 not
1 let
1 me
1 be
1 with
1 you
1 so
1 much
1 if
1 you
1 were
1 not
1 a
1 fit
1 companion
1 for
1 me
1 I
1 was
1 not
1 to
1 speak
1 of
1 it
1 but
1 she
1 means
1 to
1 be
1 your
1 friend
1 and
1 help
1 you
1 by
1 -and
1 -by
1 Does
1 she
1 And
1 the
1 boy
1 laughed
1 an
1 odd
1 short
1 laugh
1 that
1 jarred
1 on
1 Lillian
1 s
1 ear
1 and
1 made
1 her
1 say
1 reprovingly
1 You
1 are
1 proud
1 I
1 know
1 but
1 you
1 ll
1 let
1 us
1 help
1 you
1 because
1 we
1 like
1 to
1 do
1 it
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 brother
1 to
1 share
1 my
1 money
1 with
1 ould
1 you
1 like
1 one
1 or
1 a
1 sister
1 asked
1 Paul
1 looking
1 straight
1 into
1 her
1 face
1 with
1 his
1 piercing
1 eyes
1 Yes
1 indeed
1 I
1 long
1 for
1 someone
1 to
1 be
1 with
1 me
1 and
1 love
1 me
1 as
1 Mamma
1 can
1 t
1 ould
1 you
1 be
1 willing
1 to
1 share
1 everything
1 with
1 another
1 person
1 -
1 -perhaps
1 have
1 to
1 give
1 them
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 things
1 you
1 like
1 and
1 now
1 have
1 all
1 to
1 yourself
1 I
1 think
1 I
1 should
1 I
1 m
1 selfish
1 I
1 know
1 because
1 everyone
1 pets
1 and
1 spoils
1 me
1 but
1 if
1 I
1 loved
1 a
1 person
1 dearly
1 I
1 d
1 give
1 up
1 anything
1 to
1 them
1 Indeed
1 I
1 would
1 Paul
1 pray
1 believe
1 me
1 She
1 spoke
1 earnestly
1 and
1 leaned
1 on
1 his
1 shoulder
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 enforce
1 her
1 words
1 The
1 boy
1 s
1 arm
1 stole
1 around
1 the
1 little
1 figure
1 in
1 the
1 saddle
1 and
1 a
1 beautiful
1 bright
1 smile
1 broke
1 over
1 his
1 face
1 as
1 he
1 answered
1 warmly
1 I
1 do
1 believe
1 it
1 dear
1 and
1 it
1 makes
1 me
1 happy
1 to
1 hear
1 you
1 say
1 so
1 Don
1 t
1 be
1 afraid
1 I
1 m
1 your
1 equal
1 but
1 I
1 ll
1 not
1 forget
1 that
1 you
1 are
1 my
1 little
1 mistress
1 till
1 I
1 can
1 change
1 from
1 groom
1 to
1 gentleman
1 He
1 added
1 the
1 last
1 sentence
1 as
1 he
1 withdrew
1 his
1 arm
1 for
1 Lillian
1 had
1 shrunk
1 a
1 little
1 and
1 blushed
1 with
1 surprise
1 not
1 anger
1 at
1 this
1 first
1 breach
1 of
1 respect
1 on
1 the
1 part
1 of
1 her
1 companion
1 Both
1 were
1 silent
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 Paul
1 looking
1 down
1 and
1 Lillian
1 busy
1 with
1 her
1 nosegay
1 She
1 spoke
1 first
1 assuming
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 satisfaction
1 as
1 she
1 surveyed
1 her
1 work
1 That
1 will
1 please
1 Mamma
1 I
1 m
1 sure
1 and
1 make
1 her
1 quite
1 forget
1 my
1 naughty
1 prank
1 of
1 yesterday
1 Do
1 you
1 know
1 I
1 offended
1 her
1 dreadfully
1 by
1 peeping
1 into
1 the
1 gold
1 case
1 she
1 wears
1 on
1 her
1 neck
1 She
1 was
1 asleep
1 and
1 I
1 was
1 sitting
1 by
1 her
1 In
1 her
1 sleep
1 she
1 pulled
1 it
1 out
1 and
1 said
1 something
1 about
1 a
1 letter
1 and
1 Papa
1 I
1 wanted
1 to
1 see
1 Papa
1 s
1 face
1 for
1 I
1 never
1 did
1 because
1 the
1 big
1 picture
1 of
1 him
1 is
1 gone
1 from
1 the
1 gallery
1 where
1 the
1 others
1 are
1 so
1 I
1 peeped
1 into
1 the
1 case
1 when
1 she
1 let
1 it
1 drop
1 and
1 was
1 so
1 disappointed
1 to
1 find
1 nothing
1 but
1 a
1 key
1 A
1 key
1 hat
1 sort
1 of
1 a
1 key
1 cried
1 Paul
1 in
1 an
1 eager
1 tone
1 Oh
1 a
1 little
1 silver
1 one
1 like
1 the
1 key
1 of
1 my
1 piano

1 Lillian
1 tied
1 up
1 her
1 flowers
1 and
1 handed
1 them
1 to
1 Paul
1 to
1 carry
1 As
1 she
1 did
1 so
1 the
1 change
1 in
1 his
1 face
1 struck
1 her
1 How
1 grim
1 and
1 old
1 you
1 look
1 she
1 exclaimed
1 Have
1 I

1 anything
1 that

1 person
1 Paul
1 one
1 minute
1 as
1 gay
1 as
1 any
1 boy
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 as
1 grave
1 and
1 stern
1 as
1 a
1 man
1 with
1 a
1 deal
1 of
1 work
1 to
1 do
1 I
1 have
1 got

1 my
1 lady
1 hen
1 Paul
1 spoke
1 in
1 that
1 tone
1 and
1 wore
1 that
1 look
1 Lillian
1 felt
1 as
1 if
1 they
1 had
1 changed
1 places
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 the
1 master
1 and
1 she
1 the
1 servant
1 She
1 wondered
1 over
1 this
1 in
1 her
1 childish
1 mind
1 but
1 proud
1 and
1 willful
1 as
1 she
1 was
1 she
1 liked
1 it
1 and
1 obeyed
1 him
1 with
1 unusual
1 meekness
1 when
1 he
1 suggested
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 time
1 to
1 return
1 As
1 he
1 rode
1 silently
1 beside
1 her
1 she
1 stole
1 covert
1 glances
1 at
1 him
1 from
1 under
1 her
1 wide
1 hat
1 brim
1 and
1 studied
1 his
1 unconscious
1 face
1 as
1 she
1 had
1 never
1 done
1 before
1 His
1 lips
1 moved
1 now
1 and
1 then
1 but
1 uttered
1 no
1 audible
1 sound
1 his
1 black
1 brows
1 were
1 knit
1 and
1 once
1 his
1 hand
1 went
1 to
1 his
1 breast
1 as
1 if
1 he
1 thought
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 sweetheart
1 whose
1 picture
1 lay
1 there
1 He
1 s
1 got
1 a
1 trouble
1 I
1 wish
1 he
1 d
1 tell
1 me
1 and
1 let
1 me
1 help
1 him
1 if
1 I
1 can
1 I
1 ll
1 make
1 him
1 show
1 me
1 that
1 miniature
1 someday
1 for
1 I
1 m
1 interested
1 in
1 that
1 girl
1 thought
1 Lillian
1 with
1 a
1 pensive
1 sigh
1 As
1 he
1 held
1 his
1 hand
1 for
1 her
1 little
1 foot
1 in
1 dismounting
1 her
1 at
1 the
1 hall
1 door
1 Paul
1 seemed
1 to
1 have
1 shaken
1 off
1 his
1 grave
1 mood
1 for
1 he
1 looked
1 up
1 and
1 smiled
1 at
1 her
1 with
1 his
1 blithest
1 expression
1 But
1 Lillian
1 appeared
1 to
1 be
1 the
1 thoughtful
1 one
1 now
1 and
1 with
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 dignity
1 very
1 pretty
1 and
1 becoming
1 thanked
1 her
1 young
1 squire
1 in
1 a
1 stately
1 manner
1 and
1 swept
1 into
1 the
1 house
1 looking
1 tall
1 and
1 womanly
1 in
1 her
1 flowing
1 skirts
1 Paul
1 laughed
1 as
1 he
1 glanced
1 after
1 her
1 and
1 flinging
1 himself
1 onto
1 his
1 horse
1 rode
1 away
1 to
1 the
1 stables
1 at
1 a
1 reckless
1 pace
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 work
1 off
1 some
1 emotion
1 for
1 which
1 he
1 could
1 find
1 no
1 other
1 vent
1 Here
1 s
1 a
1 letter
1 for
1 you
1 lad
1 all
1 the
1 way
1 from
1 some
1 place
1 in
1 Italy
1 ho
1 do
1 you
1 know
1 there
1 said
1 Bedford
1 as
1 the
1 boy
1 came
1 back
1 ith
1 a
1 hasty
1 Thank
1 you
1 Paul
1 caught
1 the
1 letter
1 and
1 darted
1 away
1 to
1 his
1 own
1 room
1 there
1 to
1 tear
1 it
1 open
1 and
1 after
1 reading
1 a
1 single
1 line
1 to
1 drop
1 into
1 a
1 chair
1 as
1 if
1 he
1 had
1 received
1 a
1 sudden
1 blow
1 Growing
1 paler
1 and
1 paler
1 he
1 read
1 on
1 and
1 when
1 the
1 letter
1 fell
1 from
1 his
1 hands
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 in
1 a
1 tone
1 of
1 despair
1 How
1 could
1 he
1 die
1 at
1 such
1 a
1 time
1 For
1 an
1 hour
1 the
1 boy
1 sat
1 thinking
1 intently
1 with
1 locked
1 door
1 curtained
1 window
1 and
1 several
1 papers
1 strewn
1 before
1 him
1 Letters
1 memoranda
1 plans
1 drawings
1 and
1 bits
1 of
1 parchment
1 all
1 of
1 which
1 he
1 took
1 from
1 a
1 small
1 locked
1 portfolio
1 always
1 worn
1 about
1 him
1 Over
1 these
1 he
1 pored
1 with
1 a
1 face
1 in
1 which
1 hope
1 despondency
1 resolve
1 and
1 regret
1 alternated
1 rapidly
1 Taking
1 the
1 locket
1 out
1 he
1 examined
1 a
1 ring
1 which
1 lay
1 in
1 one
1 side
1 and
1 the
1 childish
1 face
1 which
1 smiled
1 on
1 him
1 from
1 the
1 other
1 His
1 eyes
1 filled
1 as
1 he
1 locked
1 and
1 put
1 it
1 by
1 saying
1 tenderly
1 Dear
1 little
1 heart
1 I
1 ll
1 not
1 forget
1 or
1 desert
1 her
1 whatever
1 happens
1 Time
1 must
1 help
1 me
1 and
1 to
1 time
1 I
1 must
1 leave
1 my
1 work
1 One
1 more
1 attempt
1 and
1 then
1 I
1 m
1 off
1 I
1 ll
1 go
1 to
1 bed
1 now
1 Hester
1 but
1 while
1 you
1 get
1 my
1 things
1 ready
1 I
1 ll
1 take
1 a
1 turn
1 in
1 the
1 corridor
1 The
1 air
1 will
1 refresh
1 me
1 As
1 she
1 spoke
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 drew
1 her
1 wrapper
1 about
1 her
1 and
1 paced
1 softly
1 down
1 the
1 long
1 hall
1 lighted
1 only
1 by
1 fitful
1 gleams
1 of
1 moonlight
1 and
1 the
1 ruddy
1 glow
1 of
1 the
1 fire
1 At
1 the
1 far
1 end
1 was
1 the
1 state
1 chamber
1 never
1 used
1 now
1 and
1 never
1 visited
1 except
1 by
1 Hester
1 who
1 occasionally
1 went
1 in
1 to
1 dust
1 and
1 air
1 it
1 and
1 my
1 lady
1 who
1 always
1 passed
1 the
1 anniversary
1 of
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 death
1 alone
1 there
1 The
1 gallery
1 was
1 very
1 dark
1 and
1 she
1 seldom
1 went
1 farther
1 than
1 the
1 last
1 window
1 in
1 her
1 restless
1 walks
1 but
1 as
1 she
1 now
1 approached
1 she
1 was
1 startled
1 to
1 see
1 a
1 streak
1 of
1 yellow
1 light
1 under
1 the
1 door
1 She
1 kept
1 the
1 key
1 herself
1 and
1 neither
1 she
1 nor
1 Hester
1 had
1 been
1 there
1 that
1 day
1 A
1 cold
1 shiver
1 passed
1 over
1 her
1 for
1 as
1 she
1 looked
1 the
1 shadow
1 of
1 a
1 foot
1 darkened
1 the
1 light
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 and
1 vanished
1 as
1 if
1 someone
1 had
1 noiselessly
1 passed
1 Obeying
1 a
1 sudden
1 impulse
1 my
1 lady
1 sprang
1 forward
1 and
1 tried
1 to
1 open
1 the
1 door
1 It
1 was
1 locked
1 but
1 as
1 her
1 hand
1 turned
1 the
1 silver
1 knob
1 a
1 sound
1 as
1 if
1 a
1 drawer
1 softly
1 closed
1 met
1 her
1 ear
1 She
1 stooped
1 to
1 the
1 keyhole
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 dark
1 a
1 key
1 evidently
1 being
1 in
1 the
1 lock
1 She
1 drew
1 back
1 and
1 flew
1 to
1 her
1 room
1 snatched
1 the
1 key
1 from
1 her
1 dressing
1 table
1 and
1 bidding
1 Hester
1 follow
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 hall
1 hat
1 is
1 it
1 my
1 lady
1 cried
1 the
1 woman
1 alarmed
1 at
1 the
1 agitation
1 of
1 her
1 mistress
1 A
1 light
1 a
1 sound
1 a
1 shadow
1 in
1 the
1 state
1 chamber
1 Come
1 quick
1 cried
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 adding
1 as
1 she
1 pointed
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 There
1 there
1 the
1 light
1 shines
1 underneath
1 Do
1 you
1 see
1 it
1 No
1 my
1 lady
1 it
1 s
1 dark
1 returned
1 Hester
1 It
1 was
1 but
1 never
1 pausing
1 my
1 lady
1 thrust
1 in
1 the
1 key
1 and
1 to
1 her
1 surprise
1 it
1 turned
1 the
1 door
1 flew
1 open
1 and
1 the
1 dim
1 still
1 room
1 was
1 before
1 them
1 Hester
1 boldly
1 entered
1 and
1 while
1 her
1 mistress
1 slowly
1 followed
1 she
1 searched
1 the
1 room
1 looking
1 behind
1 the
1 tall
1 screen
1 by
1 the
1 hearth
1 up
1 the
1 wide
1 chimney
1 in
1 the
1 great
1 wardrobe
1 and
1 under
1 the
1 ebony
1 cabinet
1 where
1 all
1 the
1 relics
1 of
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 were
1 kept
1 Nothing
1 appeared
1 not
1 even
1 a
1 mouse
1 and
1 Hester
1 turned
1 to
1 my
1 lady
1 with
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 relief
1 But
1 her
1 mistress
1 pointed
1 to
1 the
1 bed
1 shrouded
1 in
1 dark
1 velvet
1 hangings
1 and
1 whispered
1 breathlessly
1 You
1 forgot
1 to
1 look
1 there
1 Hester
1 had
1 not
1 forgotten
1 but
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 her
1 courage
1 and
1 good
1 sense
1 she
1 shrank
1 a
1 little
1 from
1 looking
1 at
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 she
1 had
1 last
1 seen
1 her
1 master
1 s
1 dead
1 face
1 She
1 believed
1 the
1 light
1 and
1 sound
1 to
1 be
1 phantoms
1 of
1 my
1 lady
1 s
1 distempered
1 fancy
1 and
1 searched
1 merely
1 to
1 satisfy
1 her
1 The
1 mystery
1 of
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 death
1 still
1 haunted
1 the
1 minds
1 of
1 all
1 who
1 remembered
1 it
1 and
1 even
1 Hester
1 felt
1 a
1 superstitious
1 dread
1 of
1 that
1 room
1 ith
1 a
1 nervous
1 laugh
1 she
1 looked
1 under
1 the
1 bed
1 and
1 drawing
1 back
1 the
1 heavy
1 curtains
1 said
1 soothingly
1 You
1 see
1 my
1 lady
1 there
1 s
1 nothing
1 there
1 But
1 the
1 words
1 died
1 on
1 her
1 lips
1 for
1 as
1 the
1 pale
1 glimmer
1 of
1 the
1 candle
1 pierced
1 the
1 gloom
1 of
1 that
1 funeral
1 couch
1 both
1 saw
1 a
1 face
1 upon
1 the
1 pillow
1 a
1 pale
1 face
1 framed
1 in
1 dark
1 hair
1 and
1 beard
1 with
1 closed
1 eyes
1 and
1 the
1 stony
1 look
1 the
1 dead
1 wear
1 A
1 loud
1 long
1 shriek
1 that
1 roused
1 the
1 house
1 broke
1 from
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 as
1 she
1 fell
1 senseless
1 at
1 the
1 bedside
1 and
1 dropping
1 both
1 curtain
1 and
1 candle
1 Hester
1 caught
1 up
1 her
1 mistress
1 and
1 fled
1 from
1 the
1 haunted
1 room
1 locking
1 the
1 door
1 behind
1 her
1 In
1 a
1 moment
1 a
1 dozen
1 servants
1 were
1 about
1 them
1 and
1 into
1 their
1 astonished
1 ears
1 Hester
1 poured
1 her
1 story
1 while
1 vainly
1 trying
1 to
1 restore
1 her
1 lady
1 Great
1 was
1 the
1 dismay
1 and
1 intense
1 the
1 unwillingness
1 of
1 anyone
1 to
1 obey
1 when
1 Hester
1 ordered
1 the
1 men
1 to
1 search
1 the
1 room
1 again
1 for
1 she
1 was
1 the
1 first
1 to
1 regain
1 her
1 self
1 -possession
1 here
1 s
1 Paul
1 He
1 s
1 the
1 heart
1 of
1 a
1 man
1 boy
1 though
1 he
1 is
1 she
1 said
1 angrily
1 as
1 the
1 men
1 hung
1 back
1 He
1 s
1 not
1 here
1 Lord
1 Maybe
1 it
1 was
1 him
1 a
1 -playing
1 tricks
1 though
1 it
1 ain
1 t
1 like
1 him
1 cried
1 Bessy
1 Lillian
1 s
1 little
1 maid
1 No
1 it
1 can
1 t
1 be
1 him
1 for
1 I
1 locked
1 him
1 in
1 myself
1 He
1 walks
1 in
1 his
1 sleep
1 sometimes
1 and
1 I
1 was
1 afraid
1 he
1 d
1 startle
1 my
1 lady
1 Let
1 him
1 sleep
1 this
1 would
1 only
1 excite
1 him
1 and
1 set
1 him
1 to
1 marching
1 again
1 Follow
1 me
1 Bedford
1 and
1 James
1 I
1 m
1 not
1 afraid
1 of
1 ghosts
1 or
1 rogues
1 ith
1 a
1 face
1 that
1 belied
1 her
1 words
1 Hester
1 led
1 the
1 way
1 to
1 the
1 awful
1 room
1 and
1 flinging
1 back
1 the
1 curtain
1 resolutely
1 looked
1 in
1 The
1 bed
1 was
1 empty
1 but
1 on
1 the
1 pillow
1 was
1 plainly
1 visible
1 the
1 mark
1 of
1 a
1 head
1 and
1 a
1 single
1 scarlet
1 stain
1 as
1 of
1 blood
1 At
1 that
1 sight
1 Hester
1 turned
1 pale
1 and
1 caught
1 the
1 butler
1 s
1 arm
1 whispering
1 with
1 a
1 shudder
1 Do
1 you
1 remember
1 the
1 night
1 we
1 put
1 him
1 in
1 his
1 coffin
1 the
1 drop
1 of
1 blood
1 that
1 fell
1 from
1 his
1 white
1 lips
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 has

1 here
1 Good
1 Lord
1 ma
1 am

1 rest
1 in

1 if
1 such
1 things
1 are
1 to

1 gasped
1 Bedford
1 backing
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 It
1 s
1 no

1 tell

1 of

1 said
1 the
1 woman
1 in
1 a
1 gloomy
1 tone
1 and
1 having
1 assured
1 herself
1 that
1 the
1 windows
1 were
1 fast
1 Hester
1 locked
1 the
1 room
1 and
1 ordered

1 Four
1 years
1 had
1 passed
1 and

1 was
1 fast
1 blooming
1 into
1 a
1 lovely
1 woman
1 proud
1 and
1 willful
1 as
1 ever
1 but
1 very
1 charming
1 and
1 already
1 a
1 belle
1 in
1 the
1 little
1 world
1 where
1 she
1 still
1 reigned
1 a
1 queen
1 Owing
1 to
1 her
1 mother
1 s
1 ill
1 health
1 she
1 was
1 allowed
1 more
1 freedom
1 than
1 is
1 usually
1 permitted
1 to
1 an
1 English
1 girl
1 of
1 her
1 age
1 and
1 during
1 the
1 season
1 often
1 went

1 Lillian
1 seemed

1 girl
1 and
1 no

1 even
1 her

1 knew

1 and

1 after
1 his
1 flight
1 Nothing
1 was
1 missed
1 he
1 went
1 without
1 his
1 wages
1 and
1 no
1 reason
1 could
1 be
1 divined
1 for
1 his
1 departure
1 except
1 the
1 foreign
1 letter
1 Bedford
1 remembered
1 it
1 but
1 forgot
1 what
1 postmark
1 it
1 bore
1 for
1 he
1 had
1 only
1 been
1 able
1 to
1 decipher
1 Italy
1 My
1 lady
1 made
1 many
1 inquiries
1 and

1 but
1 when
1 month
1 after
1 month
1 passed
1 and
1 no
1 news
1 came

1 to

1 to
1 the

1 she
1 held

1 s

1 boudoir
1 one
1 day
1 in
1 the

1 of
1 the
1 season
1 Lillian
1 lay
1 on
1 a
1 couch
1 rather
1 languid
1 after
1 a
1 ball
1 and
1 listlessly
1 begged
1 Maud
1 to
1 tell
1 her
1 story
1 for
1 she
1 was
1 dying
1 to
1 be
1 amused
1 ell

1 on

1 on

1 and
1 began
1 You
1 remember
1 reading
1 in
1 the
1 papers
1 some
1 time
1 ago
1 that
1 fine
1 account
1 of
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 who
1 took
1 part
1 in
1 the
1 Italian
1 revolution
1 and
1 did
1 that
1 heroic
1 thing
1 with

1 Yes
1 what

1 asked
1 Lillian

1 him
1 tonight
1 Go

1 on
1 Tell
1 all
1 and
1 tell
1 it
1 quickly
1 she
1 cried
1 You
1 know
1 the
1 officers
1 were
1 sitting
1 somewhere
1 holding
1 a
1 council
1 while
1 the
1 city
1 I
1 forget
1 the
1 name
1 was
1 being
1 bombarded
1 and
1 how
1 a
1 shell
1 came
1 into
1 the
1 midst
1 of
1 them
1 how
1 they
1 sat
1 paralyzed
1 expecting
1 it
1 to
1 burst
1 and
1 how
1 this
1 young
1 man
1 caught
1 it
1 up
1 and
1 ran
1 out
1 with
1 it
1 risking
1 his
1 own
1 life
1 to
1 save
1 theirs
1 Yes
1 yes
1 I
1 remember
1 And
1 Lillian
1 s
1 listless
1 face
1 kindled
1 at
1 the
1 recollection
1 ell
1 an
1 Englishman
1 who
1 was
1 there
1 was
1 so
1 charmed
1 by
1 the
1 act
1 that
1 finding
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 was
1 poor
1 and
1 an
1 orphan
1 he
1 adopted
1 him
1 Mr
1 Talbot
1 was
1 old
1 and
1 lonely
1 and
1 rich
1 and
1 when
1 he
1 died
1 a
1 year
1 after
1 he
1 left
1 his
1 name
1 and
1 fortune
1 to
1 this
1 Paolo
1 I
1 m
1 glad
1 I
1 m
1 glad
1 cried
1 Lillian
1 clapping
1 her
1 hands
1 with
1 a
1 joyful
1 face
1 How
1 romantic
1 and
1 charming
1 it
1 is
1 Isn
1 t
1 it
1 But
1 my
1 dear
1 creature
1 the
1 most
1 romantic
1 part
1 is
1 to
1 come
1 Young
1 Talbot
1 served
1 in
1 the
1 war
1 and
1 then
1 came
1 to
1 England
1 to
1 take
1 possession
1 of
1 his
1 property
1 It
1 s
1 somewhere
1 down
1 in
1 Kent
1 a
1 fine
1 place
1 and
1 good
1 income
1 all
1 his
1 and
1 he
1 deserves
1 it
1 Mamma
1 heard
1 a
1 deal
1 about
1 him
1 from
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 who
1 knew
1 old
1 Talbot
1 and
1 has
1 seen
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 Of
1 course
1 all
1 the
1 girls
1 are
1 wild
1 to
1 behold
1 him
1 for
1 he
1 is
1 very
1 handsome
1 and
1 accomplished
1 and
1 a
1 gentleman
1 by
1 birth
1 But
1 the
1 dreadful
1 part
1 is
1 that
1 he
1 is
1 already
1 betrothed
1 to
1 a
1 lovely
1 Greek
1 girl
1 who
1 came
1 over
1 at
1 the
1 same
1 time
1 and
1 is
1 living
1 in
1 London
1 with
1 a
1 companion
1 quite
1 elegantly
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 says
1 for
1 she
1 called
1 and
1 was
1 charmed
1 This
1 girl
1 has
1 been
1 seen
1 by
1 some
1 of
1 our
1 gentlemen
1 friends
1 and
1 they
1 already
1 rave
1 about
1 the
1 fair
1 Helene
1 for
1 that
1 s
1 her
1 name
1 Here
1 Maud
1 was
1 forced
1 to
1 stop
1 for
1 breath
1 and
1 Lillian
1 had
1 a
1 chance
1 to
1 question
1 her
1 How
1 old
1 is
1 she
1 About
1 eighteen
1 or
1 nineteen
1 they
1 say
1 Very
1 pretty
1 Ravishing
1 regularly
1 Greek
1 and
1 divine
1 Fred
1 Raleigh
1 says
1 hen
1 is
1 she
1 to
1 be
1 married
1 Don
1 t
1 know
1 when
1 Talbot
1 gets
1 settled
1 I
1 fancy
1 And
1 he
1 Is
1 he
1 as
1 charming
1 as
1 she
1 Quite
1 I
1 m
1 told
1 He
1 s
1 just
1 of
1 age
1 and
1 is
1 in
1 appearance
1 as
1 in
1 everything
1 else
1 a
1 hero
1 of
1 romance
1 How
1 came
1 your
1 mother
1 to
1 secure
1 him
1 for
1 tonight
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 is
1 dying
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 lion
1 of
1 him
1 and
1 begged
1 to
1 bring
1 him
1 He
1 is
1 very
1 indifferent
1 on
1 such
1 things
1 and
1 seems
1 intent
1 on
1 his
1 own
1 affairs
1 Is
1 grave
1 and
1 old
1 for
1 his
1 years
1 and
1 doesn
1 t
1 seem
1 to
1 care
1 much
1 for
1 pleasure
1 and
1 admiration
1 as
1 most
1 men
1 would
1 after
1 a
1 youth
1 like
1 his
1 for
1 he
1 has
1 had
1 a
1 hard
1 time
1 I
1 believe
1 For
1 a
1 wonder
1 he
1 consented
1 to
1 come
1 when
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 asked
1 him
1 and
1 I
1 flew
1 off
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 tell
1 you
1 and
1 secure
1 you
1 for
1 tonight
1 A
1 thousand
1 thanks
1 I
1 meant
1 to
1 rest
1 for
1 Mamma
1 frets
1 about
1 my
1 being
1 so
1 gay
1 but
1 she
1 won
1 t
1 object
1 to
1 a
1 quiet
1 evening
1 with
1 you
1 hat
1 shall
1 we
1 wear
1 And
1 here
1 the
1 conversation
1 branched
1 off
1 on
1 the
1 all
1 -absorbing
1 topic
1 of
1 dress
1 hen
1 Lillian
1 joined
1 her
1 friend
1 that
1 evening
1 the
1 hero
1 had
1 already
1 arrived
1 and
1 stepping
1 into
1 a
1 recess
1 she
1 waited
1 to
1 catch
1 a
1 glimpse
1 of
1 him
1 Maud
1 was
1 called
1 away
1 and
1 she
1 was
1 alone
1 when
1 the
1 crowd
1 about
1 the
1 inner
1 room
1 thinned
1 and
1 permitted
1 young
1 Talbot
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 ell
1 for
1 Lillian
1 that
1 no
1 one
1 observed
1 her
1 at
1 that
1 moment
1 for
1 she
1 grew
1 pale
1 and
1 sank
1 into
1 a
1 chair
1 exclaiming
1 below
1 her
1 breath
1 It
1 is
1 Paul
1 -
1 -my
1 Paul
1 She
1 recognized
1 him
1 instantly
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 increased
1 height
1 a
1 dark
1 moustache
1 and
1 martial
1 bearing
1 It
1 was
1 Paul
1 older
1 graver
1 handsomer
1 but
1 still
1 her
1 Paul
1 as
1 she
1 called
1 him
1 with
1 a
1 flush
1 of
1 pride
1 and
1 delight
1 as
1 she
1 watched
1 him
1 and
1 felt
1 that
1 of
1 all
1 there
1 she
1 knew
1 him
1 best
1 and
1 loved
1 him
1 most
1 For
1 the
1 childish
1 affection
1 still
1 existed
1 and
1 this
1 discovery
1 added
1 a
1 tinge
1 of
1 romance
1 that
1 made
1 it
1 doubly
1 dangerous
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 doubly
1 pleasant
1 ill
1 he
1 know
1 me
1 she
1 thought
1 glancing
1 at
1 a
1 mirror
1 which
1 reflected
1 a
1 slender
1 figure
1 with
1 bright
1 hair
1 white
1 arms
1 and
1 brilliant
1 eyes
1 a
1 graceful
1 little
1 head
1 proudly
1 carried
1 and
1 a
1 sweet
1 mouth
1 just
1 then
1 very
1 charming
1 as
1 it
1 smiled
1 till
1 pearly
1 teeth
1 shone
1 between
1 the
1 ruddy
1 lips
1 I
1 m
1 glad
1 I
1 m
1 not
1 ugly
1 and
1 I
1 hope
1 he
1 ll
1 like
1 me
1 she
1 thought
1 as
1 she
1 smoothed
1 the
1 golden
1 ripples
1 on
1 her
1 forehead
1 settled
1 her
1 sash
1 and
1 shook
1 out
1 the
1 folds
1 of
1 her
1 airy
1 dress
1 in
1 a
1 flutter
1 of
1 girlish
1 excitement
1 I
1 ll
1 pretend
1 not
1 to
1 know
1 him
1 when
1 we
1 meet
1 and
1 see
1 what
1 he
1 will
1 do
1 she
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 wicked
1 sense
1 of
1 power
1 for
1 being
1 forewarned
1 she
1 was
1 forearmed
1 and
1 fearing
1 no
1 betrayal
1 of
1 surprise
1 on
1 her
1 own
1 part
1 was
1 eager
1 to
1 enjoy
1 any
1 of
1 which
1 he
1 might
1 be
1 guilty
1 Leaving
1 her
1 nook
1 she
1 joined
1 a
1 group
1 of
1 young
1 friends
1 and
1 held
1 herself
1 prepared
1 for
1 the
1 meeting
1 Presently
1 she
1 saw
1 Maud
1 and
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 approaching
1 evidently
1 intent
1 on
1 presenting
1 the
1 hero
1 to
1 the
1 heiress
1 Mr
1 Talbot
1 Miss
1 Trevlyn
1 said
1 the
1 lady
1 And
1 looking
1 up
1 with
1 a
1 well
1 -assumed
1 air
1 of
1 indifference
1 Lillian
1 returned
1 the
1 gentleman
1 s
1 bow
1 with
1 her
1 eyes
1 fixed
1 full
1 upon
1 his
1 face
1 Not
1 a
1 feature
1 of
1 that
1 face
1 changed
1 and
1 so
1 severely
1 unconscious
1 of
1 any
1 recognition
1 was
1 it
1 that
1 the
1 girl
1 was
1 bewildered
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 she
1 fancied
1 she
1 had
1 been
1 mistaken
1 in
1 his
1 identity
1 and
1 a
1 pang
1 of
1 disappointment
1 troubled
1 her
1 but
1 as
1 he
1 moved
1 a
1 chair
1 for
1 Maud
1 she
1 saw
1 on
1 the
1 one
1 ungloved
1 hand
1 a
1 little
1 scar
1 which
1 she
1 remembered
1 well
1 for
1 he
1 received
1 it
1 in
1 saving
1 her
1 from
1 a
1 dangerous
1 fall
1 At
1 the
1 sight
1 all
1 the
1 happy
1 past
1 rose
1 before
1 her
1 and
1 if
1 her
1 telltale
1 eyes
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 averted
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 betrayed
1 her
1 A
1 sudden
1 flush
1 of
1 maidenly
1 shame
1 dyed
1 her
1 cheek
1 as
1 she
1 remembered
1 that
1 last
1 ride
1 and
1 the
1 childish
1 confidences
1 then
1 interchanged
1 This
1 Helen
1 was
1 the
1 little
1 sweetheart
1 whose
1 picture
1 he
1 wore
1 and
1 now
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 all
1 obstacles
1 he
1 had
1 won
1 both
1 fortune
1 and
1 ladylove
1 The
1 sound
1 of
1 his
1 voice
1 recalled
1 her
1 thoughts
1 and
1 glancing
1 up
1 she
1 met
1 the
1 deep
1 eyes
1 fixed
1 on
1 her
1 with
1 the
1 same
1 steady
1 look
1 they
1 used
1 to
1 wear
1 He
1 had
1 addressed
1 her
1 but
1 what
1 he
1 said
1 she
1 knew
1 not
1 beyond
1 a
1 vague
1 idea
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 some
1 slight
1 allusion
1 to
1 the
1 music
1 going
1 on
1 in
1 the
1 next
1 room
1 ith
1 a
1 smile
1 which
1 would
1 serve
1 for
1 an
1 answer
1 to
1 almost
1 any
1 remark
1 she
1 hastily
1 plunged
1 into
1 conversation
1 with
1 a
1 composure
1 that
1 did
1 her
1 credit
1 in
1 the
1 eyes
1 of
1 her
1 friends
1 who
1 stood
1 in
1 awe
1 of
1 the
1 young
1 hero
1 for
1 all
1 were
1 but
1 just
1 out
1 Mr
1 Talbot
1 hardly
1 needs
1 an
1 introduction
1 here
1 for
1 his
1 name
1 is
1 well
1 -known
1 among
1 us
1 though
1 this
1 is
1 perhaps
1 his
1 first
1 visit
1 to
1 England
1 she
1 said
1 flattering
1 herself
1 that
1 this
1 artful
1 speech
1 would
1 entrap
1 him
1 into
1 the
1 reply
1 she
1 wanted
1 ith
1 a
1 slight
1 frown
1 as
1 if
1 the
1 allusion
1 to
1 his
1 adventure
1 rather
1 annoyed
1 him
1 and
1 a
1 smile
1 that
1 puzzled
1 all
1 but
1 Lillian
1 he
1 answered
1 very
1 simply
1 It
1 is
1 not
1 my
1 first
1 visit
1 to
1 this
1 hospitable
1 island
1 I
1 was
1 here
1 a
1 few
1 years
1 ago
1 for
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 and
1 left
1 with
1 regret
1 Then
1 you
1 have
1 old
1 friends
1 here
1 And
1 Lillian
1 watched
1 him
1 as
1 she
1 spoke
1 I
1 had
1 They
1 had
1 doubtless
1 forgotten
1 me
1 now
1 he
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 sudden
1 shadow
1 marring
1 the
1 tranquillity
1 of
1 his
1 face
1 hy
1 doubt
1 them
1 If
1 they
1 were
1 true
1 friends
1 they
1 will
1 not
1 forget
1 The
1 words
1 were
1 uttered
1 impulsively
1 almost
1 warmly
1 but
1 Talbot
1 made
1 no
1 response
1 except
1 a
1 polite
1 inclination
1 and
1 an
1 abrupt
1 change
1 in
1 the
1 conversation
1 That
1 remains
1 to
1 be
1 proved
1 Do
1 you
1 sing
1 Miss
1 Trevlyn
1 A
1 little
1 And
1 Lillian
1 s
1 tone
1 was
1 both
1 cold
1 and
1 proud
1 A
1 great
1 deal
1 and
1 very
1 charmingly
1 added
1 Maud
1 who
1 took
1 pride
1 in
1 her
1 friend
1 s
1 gifts
1 both
1 of
1 voice
1 and
1 beauty
1 Come
1 dear
1 there
1 are
1 so
1 few
1 of
1 us
1 you
1 will
1 sing
1 I
1 know
1 Mamma
1 desired
1 me
1 to
1 ask
1 you
1 when
1 Edith
1 had
1 done
1 To
1 her
1 surprise
1 Lillian
1 complied
1 and
1 allowed
1 Talbot
1 to
1 lead
1 her
1 to
1 the
1 instrument
1 Still
1 hoping
1 to
1 win
1 some
1 sign
1 of
1 recognition
1 from
1 him
1 the
1 girl
1 chose
1 an
1 air
1 he
1 taught
1 her
1 and
1 sang
1 it
1 with
1 a
1 spirit
1 and
1 skill
1 that
1 surprised
1 the
1 listeners
1 who
1 possessed
1 no
1 key
1 to
1 her
1 mood
1 At
1 the
1 last
1 verse
1 her
1 voice
1 suddenly
1 faltered
1 but
1 Talbot
1 took
1 up
1 the
1 song
1 and
1 carried
1 her
1 safely
1 through
1 it
1 with
1 his
1 well
1 -tuned
1 voice
1 You
1 know
1 the
1 air
1 then
1 she
1 said
1 in
1 a
1 low
1 tone
1 as
1 a
1 hum
1 of
1 commendation
1 followed
1 the
1 music
1 All
1 Italians
1 sing
1 it
1 though
1 few
1 do
1 it
1 like
1 yourself
1 he
1 answered
1 quietly
1 restoring
1 the
1 fan
1 he
1 had
1 held
1 while
1 standing
1 beside
1 her
1 Provoking
1 boy
1 why
1 won
1 t
1 he
1 know
1 me
1 thought
1 Lillian
1 And
1 her
1 tone
1 was
1 almost
1 petulant
1 as
1 she
1 refused
1 to
1 sing
1 again
1 Talbot
1 offered
1 his
1 arm
1 and
1 led
1 her
1 to
1 a
1 seat
1 behind
1 which
1 stood
1 a
1 little
1 statuette
1 of
1 a
1 child
1 holding
1 a
1 fawn
1 by
1 a
1 daisy
1 chain
1 Pretty
1 isn
1 t
1 it
1 she
1 said
1 as
1 he
1 paused
1 to
1 look
1 at
1 it
1 instead
1 of
1 taking
1 the
1 chair
1 before
1 her
1 I
1 used
1 to
1 enjoy
1 modeling
1 tiny
1 deer
1 and
1 hinds
1 in
1 wax
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 making
1 daisy
1 chains
1 Is
1 sculpture
1 among
1 the
1 many
1 accomplishments
1 which
1 rumor
1 tells
1 us
1 you
1 possess
1 No
1 Those
1 who
1 like
1 me
1 have
1 their
1 own
1 fortunes
1 to
1 mold
1 find
1 time
1 for
1 little
1 else
1 he
1 answered
1 gravely
1 still
1 examining
1 the
1 marble
1 group
1 Lillian
1 broke
1 her
1 fan
1 with
1 an
1 angry
1 flirt
1 for
1 she
1 was
1 tired
1 of
1 her
1 trial
1 and
1 wished
1 she
1 had
1 openly
1 greeted
1 him
1 at
1 the
1 beginning
1 feeling
1 now
1 how
1 pleasant
1 it
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 to
1 sit
1 chatting
1 of
1 old
1 times
1 while
1 her
1 friends
1 dared
1 hardly
1 address
1 him
1 at
1 all
1 She
1 was
1 on
1 the
1 point
1 of
1 calling
1 him
1 by
1 his
1 former
1 name
1 when
1 the
1 remembrance
1 of
1 what
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 arrested
1 the
1 words
1 on
1 her
1 lips
1 He
1 was
1 proud
1 would
1 he
1 not
1 dread
1 to
1 have
1 it
1 known
1 that
1 in
1 his
1 days
1 of
1 adversity
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 a
1 servant
1 For
1 if
1 she
1 betrayed
1 her
1 knowledge
1 of
1 his
1 past
1 she
1 would
1 be
1 forced
1 to
1 tell
1 where
1 and
1 how
1 that
1 knowledge
1 was
1 gained
1 No
1 better
1 wait
1 till
1 they
1 met
1 alone
1 she
1 thought
1 he
1 would
1 thank
1 her
1 for
1 her
1 delicacy
1 and
1 she
1 could
1 easily
1 explain
1 her
1 motive
1 He
1 evidently
1 wished
1 to
1 seem
1 a
1 stranger
1 for
1 once
1 she
1 caught
1 a
1 gleam
1 of
1 the
1 old
1 mirthful
1 mischief
1 in
1 his
1 eye
1 as
1 she
1 glanced
1 up
1 unexpectedly
1 He
1 did
1 remember
1 her
1 she
1 was
1 sure
1 yet
1 was
1 trying
1 her
1 perhaps
1 as
1 she
1 tried
1 him
1 ell
1 she
1 would
1 stand
1 the
1 test
1 and
1 enjoy
1 the
1 joke
1 by
1 -and
1 -by
1 ith
1 this
1 fancy
1 in
1 her
1 head
1 she
1 assumed
1 a
1 gracious
1 air
1 and
1 chatted
1 away
1 in
1 her
1 most
1 charming
1 style
1 feeling
1 both
1 gay
1 and
1 excited
1 so
1 anxious
1 was
1 she
1 to
1 please
1 and
1 so
1 glad
1 to
1 recover
1 her
1 early
1 friend
1 A
1 naughty
1 whim
1 seized
1 her
1 as
1 her
1 eye
1 fell
1 on
1 a
1 portfolio
1 of
1 classical
1 engravings
1 which
1 someone
1 had
1 left
1 in
1 disorder
1 on
1 a
1 table
1 near
1 her
1 Tossing
1 them
1 over
1 she
1 asked
1 his
1 opinion
1 of
1 several
1 and
1 then
1 handed
1 him
1 one
1 in
1 which
1 Helen
1 of
1 Troy
1 was
1 represented
1 as
1 giving
1 her
1 hand
1 to
1 the
1 irresistible
1 Paris
1 Do
1 you
1 think
1 her
1 worth
1 so
1 much
1 bloodshed
1 and
1 deserving
1 so
1 much
1 praise
1 she
1 asked
1 vainly
1 trying
1 to
1 conceal
1 the
1 significant
1 smile
1 that
1 would
1 break
1 loose
1 on
1 her
1 lips
1 and
1 sparkle
1 in
1 her
1 eyes
1 Talbot
1 laughed
1 the
1 short
1 boyish
1 laugh
1 so
1 familiar
1 to
1 her
1 ears
1 as
1 he
1 glanced
1 from
1 the
1 picture
1 to
1 the
1 arch
1 questioner
1 and
1 answered
1 in
1 a
1 tone
1 that
1 made
1 her
1 heart
1 beat
1 with
1 a
1 nameless
1 pain
1 and
1 pleasure
1 so
1 full
1 of
1 suppressed
1 ardor
1 was
1 it
1 Yes
1 All
1 for
1 love
1 or
1 the
1 world
1 well
1 lost
1 is
1 a
1 saying
1 I
1 heartily
1 agree
1 to
1 La
1 belle
1 Helene
1 is
1 my
1 favorite
1 heroine
1 and
1 I
1 regard
1 Paris
1 as
1 the
1 most
1 enviable
1 of
1 men
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 to
1 see
1 her
1 The
1 wish
1 broke
1 from
1 Lillian
1 involuntarily
1 and
1 she
1 was
1 too
1 much
1 confused
1 to
1 turn
1 it
1 off
1 by
1 any
1 general
1 expression
1 of
1 interest
1 in
1 the
1 classical
1 lady
1 You
1 may
1 sometime
1 answered
1 Talbot
1 with
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 amusement
1 adding
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 relieve
1 her
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 poetical
1 belief
1 that
1 all
1 the
1 lovely
1 women
1 of
1 history
1 or
1 romance
1 will
1 meet
1 and
1 know
1 and
1 love
1 each
1 other
1 in
1 some
1 charming
1 hereafter
1 But
1 I
1 m
1 no
1 heroine
1 and
1 no
1 beauty
1 so
1 I
1 shall
1 never
1 enter
1 your
1 poetical
1 paradise
1 said
1 Lillian
1 with
1 a
1 pretty
1 affectation
1 of
1 regret
1 Some
1 women
1 are
1 beauties
1 without
1 knowing
1 it
1 and
1 the
1 heroines
1 of
1 romances
1 never
1 given
1 to
1 the
1 world
1 I
1 think
1 you
1 and
1 Helen
1 will
1 yet
1 meet
1 Miss
1 Trevlyn
1 As
1 he
1 spoke
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 beckoned
1 and
1 he
1 left
1 her
1 pondering
1 over
1 his
1 last
1 words
1 and
1 conscious
1 of
1 a
1 secret
1 satisfaction
1 in
1 his
1 implied
1 promise
1 that
1 she
1 should
1 see
1 his
1 betrothed
1 How
1 do
1 you
1 like
1 him
1 whispered
1 Maud
1 slipping
1 into
1 the
1 empty
1 chair
1 Very
1 well
1 was
1 the
1 composed
1 reply
1 for
1 Lillian
1 enjoyed
1 her
1 little
1 mystery
1 too
1 much
1 to
1 spoil
1 it
1 yet
1 hat
1 did
1 you
1 say
1 to
1 him
1 I
1 longed
1 to
1 hear
1 for
1 you
1 seemed
1 to
1 enjoy
1 yourselves
1 very
1 much
1 but
1 I
1 didn
1 t
1 like
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 marplot
1 Lillian
1 repeated
1 a
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 conversation
1 and
1 Maud
1 professed
1 to
1 be
1 consumed
1 with
1 jealousy
1 at
1 the
1 impression
1 her
1 friend
1 had
1 evidently
1 made
1 It
1 is
1 folly
1 to
1 try
1 to
1 win
1 the
1 hero
1 for
1 he
1 is
1 already
1 won
1 you
1 know
1 answered
1 Lillian
1 shutting
1 the
1 cover
1 on
1 the
1 pictured
1 Helen
1 with
1 a
1 sudden
1 motion
1 as
1 if
1 glad
1 to
1 extinguish
1 her
1 Oh
1 dear
1 no
1 Mrs
1 Langdon
1 just
1 told
1 Mamma
1 that
1 she
1 was
1 mistaken
1 about
1 their
1 being
1 engaged
1 for
1 she
1 asked
1 him
1 and
1 he
1 shook
1 his
1 head
1 saying
1 Helen
1 was
1 his
1 ward
1 But
1 that
1 is
1 absurd
1 for
1 he
1 s
1 only
1 a
1 boy
1 himself
1 It
1 s
1 very
1 odd
1 isn
1 t
1 it
1 Never
1 mind
1 I
1 shall
1 soon
1 know
1 all
1 about
1 it
1 How
1 cried
1 Maud
1 amazed
1 at
1 Lillian
1 s
1 assured
1 manner
1 ait
1 a
1 day
1 or
1 two
1 and
1 I
1 ll
1 tell
1 you

1 Good
1 night
1 I
1 ve
1 had
1 a
1 charming
1 time
1 And
1 with
1 this
1 tantalizing
1 adieu
1 Lillian
1 slipped
1 away
1 Hester
1 was
1 waiting
1 in
1 the
1 carriage
1 but
1 as
1 Lillian
1 appeared
1 Talbot
1 put
1 aside
1 the
1 footman
1 and
1 handed
1 her
1 in
1 saying
1 very
1 low
1 in
1 the
1 well
1 -remembered
1 tone
1 Good
1 night

1 mistress
1 Chapter
1 VI
1 FAIR
1 HELEN
1 To
1 no
1 one
1 but
1 her
1 mother
1 and
1 Hester
1 did
1 Lillian
1 confide
1 the
1 discovery
1 she
1 had
1 made
1 None
1 of
1 the
1 former
1 servants
1 but
1 old
1 Bedford
1 remained
1 with
1 them
1 and
1 till
1 Paul
1 chose
1 to
1 renew
1 the
1 old
1 friendship
1 it
1 was
1 best
1 to
1 remain
1 silent
1 Great
1 was
1 the
1 surprise
1 and
1 delight
1 of
1 our
1 lady
1 and
1 Hester
1 at
1 the
1 good
1 fortune
1 of
1 their
1 protege
1 and
1 many
1 the
1 conjectures
1 as
1 to
1 how
1 he
1 would
1 explain
1 his
1 hasty
1 flight
1 You
1 will
1 go
1 and
1 see
1 him
1 won
1 t
1 you
1 Mamma
1 or
1 at
1 least
1 inquire
1 about
1 him
1 said
1 Lillian
1 eager
1 to
1 assure
1 the
1 wanderer
1 of
1 a
1 welcome
1 for
1 those
1 few
1 words
1 of
1 his
1 had
1 satisfied
1 her
1 entirely
1 No
1 dear
1 it
1 is
1 for
1 him
1 to
1 seek
1 us
1 and
1 till
1 he
1 does
1 I
1 shall
1 make
1 no
1 sign
1 He
1 knows
1 where
1 we
1 are
1 and
1 if
1 he
1 chooses
1 he
1 can
1 renew
1 the
1 acquaintance
1 so
1 strangely
1 broken
1 off
1 Be
1 patient
1 and
1 above
1 all
1 things
1 remember
1 Lillian
1 that
1 you
1 are
1 no
1 longer
1 a
1 child
1 replied
1 my
1 lady
1 rather
1 disturbed
1 by
1 her
1 daughter
1 s
1 enthusiastic
1 praises
1 of
1 Paul
1 I
1 wish
1 I
1 was
1 for
1 then
1 I
1 might
1 act
1 as
1 I
1 feel
1 and
1 not
1 be
1 afraid
1 of
1 shocking
1 the
1 proprieties
1 And
1 Lillian
1 went
1 to
1 bed
1 to
1 dream
1 of
1 her
1 hero
1 For
1 three
1 days
1 she
1 stayed
1 at
1 home
1 expecting
1 Paul
1 but
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 come
1 and
1 she
1 went
1 out
1 for
1 her
1 usual
1 ride
1 in
1 the
1 Park
1 hoping
1 to
1 meet
1 him
1 An
1 elderly
1 groom
1 now
1 rode
1 behind
1 her
1 and
1 she
1 surveyed
1 him
1 with
1 extreme
1 disgust
1 as
1 she
1 remembered
1 the
1 handsome
1 lad
1 who
1 had
1 once
1 filled
1 that
1 place
1 Nowhere
1 did
1 Paul
1 appear
1 but
1 in
1 the
1 Ladies
1 Mile
1 she
1 passed
1 an
1 elegant
1 brougham
1 in
1 which
1 sat
1 a
1 very
1 lovely
1 girl
1 and
1 a
1 mild
1 old
1 lady
1 That
1 is
1 Talbot
1 s
1 fiancee
1 said
1 Maud
1 Churchill
1 who
1 had
1 joined
1 her
1 Isn
1 t
1 she
1 beautiful
1 Not
1 at
1 all
1 -
1 -yes
1 very
1 was
1 Lillian
1 s
1 somewhat
1 peculiar
1 reply
1 for
1 jealousy
1 and
1 truth
1 had
1 a
1 conflict
1 just
1 then
1 He

1 so
1 perfectly
1 absorbed
1 and
1 devoted
1 that
1 I
1 am
1 sure
1 that
1 story
1 is
1 true
1 so
1 adieu
1 to
1 our
1 hopes
1 laughed
1 Maud
1 Did
1 you
1 have
1 any
1 Good
1 -bye
1 I
1 must
1 go
1 And
1 Lillian
1 rode
1 home
1 at
1 a
1 pace
1 which
1 caused
1 the
1 stout
1 groom
1 great
1 distress
1 Mamma
1 I
1 ve
1 seen
1 Paul
1 s
1 betrothed
1 she
1 cried
1 running
1 into
1 her
1 mother
1 s
1 boudoir
1 And
1 I
1 have
1 seen
1 Paul
1 himself
1 replied
1 my
1 lady
1 with
1 a
1 warning
1 look
1 for
1 there
1 he
1 stood
1 with
1 half
1 -extended
1 hand
1 as
1 if
1 waiting
1 to
1 be
1 acknowledged
1 Lillian
1 forgot
1 her
1 embarrassment
1 in
1 her
1 pleasure
1 and
1 made
1 him
1 an
1 elaborate
1 curtsy
1 saying
1 with
1 a
1 half
1 -merry
1 half
1 -reproachful
1 glance
1 Mr
1 Talbot
1 is
1 welcome
1 in
1 whatever
1 guise
1 he
1 appears
1 I
1 choose
1 to
1 appear
1 as
1 Paul
1 then
1 and
1 offer
1 you
1 a
1 seat
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 he
1 said
1 assuming
1 as
1 much
1 of
1 his
1 boyish
1 manner
1 as
1 he
1 could
1 Lillian
1 took
1 it
1 and
1 tried
1 to
1 feel
1 at
1 ease
1 but
1 the
1 difference
1 between
1 the
1 lad
1 she
1 remembered
1 and
1 the
1 man
1 she
1 now
1 saw
1 was
1 too
1 great
1 to
1 be
1 forgotten
1 Now
1 tell
1 us
1 your
1 adventures
1 and
1 why
1 you
1 vanished
1 away
1 so
1 mysteriously
1 four
1 years
1 ago
1 she
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 touch
1 of
1 the
1 childish
1 imperiousness
1 in
1 her
1 voice
1 though
1 her
1 frank
1 eyes
1 fell
1 before
1 his
1 I
1 was
1 about
1 to
1 do
1 so
1 when
1 you
1 appeared
1 with
1 news
1 concerning
1 my
1 cousin
1 he
1 began
1 Your
1 cousin
1 exclaimed
1 Lillian
1 Yes
1 Helen
1 s
1 mother
1 and
1 my
1 own
1 were
1 sisters
1 Both
1 married
1 Englishmen
1 both
1 died
1 young
1 leaving
1 us
1 to
1 care
1 for
1 each
1 other
1 e
1 were
1 like
1 a
1 brother
1 and
1 sister
1 and
1 always
1 together
1 till
1 I
1 left
1 her
1 to
1 serve
1 Colonel
1 Daventry
1 The
1 death
1 of
1 the
1 old
1 priest
1 to
1 whom
1 I
1 entrusted
1 her
1 recalled
1 me
1 to
1 Genoa
1 for
1 I
1 was
1 then
1 her
1 only
1 guardian
1 I
1 meant
1 to
1 have
1 taken
1 leave
1 of
1 you
1 my
1 lady
1 properly
1 but
1 the
1 consequences
1 of
1 that
1 foolish
1 trick
1 of
1 mine
1 frightened
1 me
1 away
1 in
1 the
1 most
1 unmannerly
1 fashion
1 Ah
1 it
1 was
1 you
1 then
1 in
1 the
1 state
1 chamber
1 I
1 always
1 thought
1 so
1 and
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 drew
1 a
1 long
1 breath
1 of
1 relief
1 Yes
1 I
1 heard
1 it
1 whispered
1 among
1 the
1 servants
1 that
1 the
1 room
1 was
1 haunted
1 and
1 I
1 felt
1 a
1 wish
1 to
1 prove
1 the
1 truth
1 of
1 the
1 story
1 and
1 my
1 own
1 courage
1 Hester
1 locked
1 me
1 in
1 for
1 fear
1 of
1 my
1 sleepwalking
1 but
1 I
1 lowered
1 myself
1 by
1 a
1 rope
1 and
1 then
1 climbed
1 in
1 at
1 the
1 closet
1 window
1 of
1 the
1 state
1 chamber
1 hen
1 you
1 came
1 my
1 lady
1 I
1 thought
1 it
1 was
1 Hester
1 and
1 slipped
1 into
1 the
1 bed
1 meaning
1 to
1 give
1 her
1 a
1 fright
1 in
1 return
1 for
1 her
1 turning
1 the
1 key
1 on
1 me
1 But
1 when
1 your
1 cry
1 showed
1 me
1 what
1 I
1 had
1 done
1 I
1 was
1 filled
1 with
1 remorse
1 and
1 escaped
1 as
1 quickly
1 and
1 quietly
1 as
1 possible
1 I
1 should
1 have
1 asked
1 pardon
1 before
1 I
1 do
1 now
1 most
1 humbly
1 my
1 lady
1 for
1 it
1 was
1 sacrilege
1 to
1 play
1 pranks
1 there
1 During
1 the
1 first
1 part
1 of
1 his
1 story
1 Paul
1 s
1 manner
1 had
1 been
1 frank
1 and
1 composed
1 but
1 in
1 telling
1 the
1 latter
1 part
1 his
1 demeanor
1 underwent
1 a
1 curious
1 change
1 He
1 fixed
1 his
1 eyes
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 and
1 spoke
1 as
1 if
1 repeating
1 a
1 lesson
1 while
1 his
1 color
1 varied
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 -proud
1 half
1 -submissive
1 expression
1 replaced
1 the
1 former
1 candid
1 one
1 Lillian
1 observed
1 this
1 and
1 it
1 disturbed
1 her
1 but
1 my
1 lady
1 took
1 it
1 for
1 shame
1 at
1 his
1 boyish
1 freak
1 and
1 received
1 his
1 confession
1 kindly
1 granting
1 a
1 free
1 pardon
1 and
1 expressing
1 sincere
1 pleasure
1 at
1 his
1 amended
1 fortunes
1 As
1 he
1 listened
1 Lillian
1 saw
1 him
1 clench
1 his
1 hand
1 hard
1 and
1 knit
1 his
1 brows
1 assuming
1 the
1 grim
1 look
1 she
1 had
1 often
1 seen
1 as
1 if
1 trying
1 to
1 steel
1 himself
1 against
1 some
1 importunate
1 emotion
1 or
1 rebellious
1 thought
1 Yes
1 half
1 my
1 work
1 is
1 done
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 home
1 thanks
1 to
1 my
1 generous
1 benefactor
1 and
1 I
1 hope
1 to
1 enjoy
1 it
1 well
1 and
1 wisely
1 he
1 said
1 in
1 a
1 grave
1 tone
1 as
1 if
1 the
1 fortune
1 had
1 not
1 yet
1 brought
1 him
1 his
1 heart
1 s
1 desire
1 And
1 when
1 is
1 the
1 other
1 half
1 of
1 the
1 work
1 to
1 be
1 accomplished
1 Paul
1 That
1 depends
1 on
1 your
1 cousin
1 perhaps
1 And
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 regarded
1 him
1 with
1 a
1 gleam
1 of
1 womanly
1 curiosity
1 in
1 her
1 melancholy
1 eyes
1 It
1 does
1 but
1 not
1 in
1 the
1 way
1 you
1 fancy
1 my
1 lady
1 hatever
1 Helen
1 may
1 be
1 she
1 is
1 not
1 my
1 fiancee
1 yet
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 And
1 the
1 shadow
1 lifted
1 as
1 he
1 laughed
1 looking
1 at
1 the
1 young
1 lady
1 who
1 was
1 decidedly
1 abashed
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 a
1 sense
1 of
1 relief
1 caused
1 by
1 his
1 words
1 I
1 merely
1 accepted
1 the
1 world
1 s
1 report
1 she
1 said
1 affecting
1 a
1 nonchalant
1 air
1 The
1 world
1 is
1 a
1 liar
1 as
1 you
1 will
1 find
1 in
1 time
1 was
1 his
1 abrupt
1 reply
1 I
1 hope
1 to
1 see
1 this
1 beautiful
1 cousin
1 Paul
1 ill
1 she
1 receive
1 us
1 as
1 old
1 friends
1 of
1 yours
1 Thanks
1 not
1 yet
1 my
1 lady
1 She
1 is
1 still
1 too
1 much
1 a
1 stranger
1 here
1 to
1 enjoy
1 new
1 faces
1 even
1 kind
1 ones
1 I
1 have
1 promised
1 perfect
1 rest
1 and
1 freedom
1 for
1 a
1 tune
1 but
1 you
1 shall
1 be
1 the
1 first
1 whom
1 she
1 receives
1 Again
1 Lillian
1 detected
1 the
1 secret
1 disquiet
1 which
1 possessed
1 him
1 and
1 her
1 curiosity
1 was
1 roused
1 It
1 piqued
1 her
1 that
1 this
1 Helen
1 felt
1 no
1 desire
1 to
1 meet
1 her
1 and
1 chose
1 to
1 seclude
1 herself
1 as
1 if
1 regardless
1 of
1 the
1 interest
1 and
1 admiration
1 she
1 excited
1 I
1 will
1 see
1 her
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 her
1 refusal
1 for
1 I
1 only
1 caught
1 a
1 glimpse
1 in
1 the
1 Park
1 Something
1 is
1 wrong
1 and
1 I
1 ll
1 discover
1 it
1 for
1 it
1 evidently
1 worries
1 Paul
1 and
1 perhaps
1 I
1 can
1 help
1 him
1 As
1 this
1 purpose
1 sprang
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 warm
1 but
1 willful
1 heart
1 of
1 the
1 girl
1 she
1 regained
1 her
1 spirits
1 and
1 was
1 her
1 most
1 charming
1 self
1 while
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 stayed
1 They
1 talked
1 of
1 many
1 things
1 in
1 a
1 pleasant
1 confidential
1 manner
1 though
1 when
1 Lillian
1 recalled
1 that
1 hour
1 she
1 was
1 surprised
1 to
1 find
1 how
1 little
1 Paul
1 had
1 really
1 told
1 them
1 of
1 his
1 past
1 life
1 or
1 future
1 plans
1 It
1 was
1 agreed
1 among
1 them
1 to
1 say
1 nothing
1 of
1 their
1 former
1 relations
1 except
1 to
1 old
1 Bedford
1 who
1 was
1 discretion
1 itself
1 but
1 to
1 appear
1 to
1 the
1 world
1 as
1 new
1 -made
1 friends
1 -
1 -thus
1 avoiding
1 unpleasant
1 and
1 unnecessary
1 explanations
1 which
1 would
1 only
1 excite
1 gossip
1 My
1 lady
1 asked
1 him
1 to
1 dine
1 but
1 he
1 had
1 business
1 out
1 of
1 town
1 and
1 declined
1 taking
1 his
1 leave
1 with
1 a
1 lingering
1 look
1 which
1 made
1 Lillian
1 steal
1 away
1 to
1 study
1 her
1 face
1 in
1 the
1 mirror
1 and
1 wonder
1 if
1 she
1 looked
1 her
1 best
1 for
1 in
1 Paul
1 s
1 eyes
1 she
1 had
1 read
1 undisguised
1 admiration
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 went
1 to
1 her
1 room
1 to
1 rest
1 leaving
1 the
1 girl
1 free
1 to
1 ride
1 drive
1 or
1 amuse
1 herself
1 as
1 she
1 liked
1 As
1 if
1 fearing
1 her
1 courage
1 would
1 fail
1 if
1 she
1 delayed
1 Lillian
1 ordered
1 the
1 carriage
1 and
1 bidding
1 Hester
1 mount
1 guard
1 over
1 her
1 she
1 drove
1 away
1 to
1 St
1 John
1 s
1 ood
1 Now
1 Hester
1 don
1 t
1 lecture
1 or
1 be
1 prim
1 when
1 I
1 tell
1 you
1 that
1 we
1 are
1 going
1 on
1 a
1 frolic
1 she
1 began
1 after
1 getting
1 the
1 old
1 woman
1 into
1 an
1 amiable
1 mood
1 by
1 every
1 winning
1 wile
1 she
1 could
1 devise
1 I
1 think
1 you
1 ll
1 like
1 it
1 and
1 if
1 it
1 s
1 found
1 out
1 I
1 ll
1 take
1 the
1 blame
1 There
1 is
1 some
1 mystery
1 about
1 Paul
1 s
1 cousin
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 going
1 to
1 find
1 it
1 out
1 Bless
1 you
1 child
1 how
1 She
1 lives
1 alone
1 here
1 is
1 seldom
1 seen
1 and
1 won
1 t
1 go
1 anywhere
1 or
1 receive
1 anyone
1 That
1 s
1 not
1 natural
1 in
1 a
1 pretty
1 girl
1 Paul
1 won
1 t
1 talk
1 about
1 her
1 and
1 though
1 he
1 s
1 fond
1 of
1 her
1 he
1 always
1 looks
1 grave
1 and
1 grim
1 when
1 I
1 ask
1 questions
1 That
1 s
1 provoking
1 and
1 I
1 won
1 t
1 hear
1 it
1 Maud
1 is
1 engaged
1 to
1 Raleigh
1 you
1 know
1 well
1 he
1 confided
1 to
1 her
1 that
1 he
1 and
1 a
1 friend
1 had
1 found
1 out
1 where
1 Helen
1 was
1 had
1 gone
1 to
1 the
1 next
1 villa
1 which
1 is
1 empty
1 and
1 under
1 pretense
1 of
1 looking
1 at
1 it
1 got
1 a
1 peep
1 at
1 the
1 girl
1 in
1 her
1 garden
1 I
1 m
1 going
1 to
1 do
1 the
1 same
1 And
1 what
1 am
1 I
1 to
1 do
1 asked
1 Hester
1 secretly
1 relishing
1 the
1 prank
1 for
1 she
1 was
1 dying
1 with
1 curiosity
1 to
1 behold
1 Paul
1 s
1 cousin
1 You
1 are
1 to
1 do
1 the
1 talking
1 with
1 the
1 old
1 woman
1 and
1 give
1 me
1 a
1 chance
1 to
1 look
1 Now
1 say
1 you
1 will
1 and
1 I
1 ll
1 behave
1 myself
1 like
1 an
1 angel
1 in
1 return
1 Hester
1 yielded
1 after
1 a
1 few
1 discreet
1 scruples
1 and
1 when
1 they
1 reached
1 Laburnum
1 Lodge
1 played
1 her
1 part
1 so
1 well
1 that
1 Lillian
1 soon
1 managed
1 to
1 stray
1 away
1 into
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 upper
1 rooms
1 which
1 overlooked
1 the
1 neighboring
1 garden
1 Helen
1 was
1 there
1 and
1 with
1 eager
1 eyes
1 the
1 girl
1 scrutinized
1 her
1 She
1 was
1 very
1 beautiful
1 in
1 the
1 classical
1 style
1 as
1 fair
1 and
1 finely
1 molded
1 as
1 a
1 statue
1 with
1 magnificent
1 dark
1 hair
1 and
1 eyes
1 and
1 possessed
1 of
1 that
1 perfect
1 grace
1 which
1 is
1 as
1 effective
1 as
1 beauty
1 She
1 was
1 alone
1 and
1 when
1 first
1 seen
1 was
1 bending
1 over
1 a
1 flower
1 which
1 she
1 caressed
1 and
1 seemed
1 to
1 examine
1 with
1 great
1 interest
1 as
1 she
1 stood
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 motionless
1 before
1 it
1 Then
1 she
1 began
1 to
1 pace
1 slowly
1 around
1 and
1 around
1 the
1 little
1 grass
1 plot
1 her
1 hands
1 hanging
1 loosely
1 clasped
1 before
1 her
1 and
1 her
1 eyes
1 fixed
1 on
1 vacancy
1 as
1 if
1 absorbed
1 in
1 thought
1 But
1 as
1 the
1 first
1 effect
1 of
1 her
1 beauty
1 passed
1 away
1 Lillian
1 found
1 something
1 peculiar
1 about
1 her
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 the
1 somewhat
1 foreign
1 dress
1 and
1 ornaments
1 she
1 wore
1 it
1 was
1 in
1 her
1 face
1 her
1 movements
1 and
1 the
1 tone
1 of
1 her
1 voice
1 for
1 as
1 she
1 walked
1 she
1 sang
1 a
1 low
1 monotonous
1 song
1 as
1 if
1 unconsciously
1 Lillian
1 watched
1 her
1 keenly
1 marking
1 the
1 aimless
1 motions
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 hands
1 the
1 apathy
1 of
1 the
1 lovely
1 face
1 and
1 the
1 mirthless
1 accent
1 of
1 the
1 voice
1 but
1 most
1 of
1 all
1 the
1 vacant
1 fixture
1 of
1 the
1 great
1 dark
1 eyes
1 Around
1 and
1 around
1 she
1 went
1 with
1 an
1 elastic
1 step
1 and
1 a
1 mechanical
1 regularity
1 wearisome
1 to
1 witness
1 hat
1 is
1 the
1 matter
1 with
1 her
1 thought
1 Lillian
1 anxiously
1 as
1 this
1 painful
1 impression
1 increased
1 with
1 every
1 scrutiny
1 of
1 the
1 unconscious
1 girl
1 So
1 abashed
1 was
1 she
1 that
1 Hester
1 s
1 call
1 was
1 unheard
1 and
1 Hester
1 was
1 unseen
1 as
1 she
1 came
1 and
1 stood
1 beside
1 her
1 Both
1 looked
1 a
1 moment
1 and
1 as
1 they
1 looked
1 an
1 old
1 lady
1 came
1 from
1 the
1 house
1 and
1 led
1 Helen
1 in
1 still
1 murmuring
1 her
1 monotonous
1 song
1 and
1 moving
1 her
1 hands
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 catch
1 and
1 hold
1 the
1 sunshine
1 Poor
1 dear
1 poor
1 dear
1 No
1 wonder
1 Paul
1 turns
1 sad
1 and
1 won
1 t
1 talk
1 of
1 her
1 and
1 that
1 she
1 don
1 t
1 see
1 anyone
1 sighed
1 Hester
1 pitifully
1 hat
1 is
1 it
1 I
1 see
1 but
1 don
1 t
1 understand
1 whispered
1 Lillian
1 She
1 s
1 an
1 innocent
1 deary
1 an
1 idiot
1 though
1 that
1 s
1 a
1 hard
1 word
1 for
1 a
1 pretty
1 creature
1 like
1 her
1 How
1 terrible
1 Come
1 away
1 Hester
1 and
1 never
1 breathe
1 to
1 anyone
1 what
1 we
1 have
1 seen
1 And
1 with
1 a
1 shudder
1 and
1 sense
1 of
1 pain
1 and
1 pity
1 lying
1 heavy
1 at
1 her
1 heart
1 she
1 hurried
1 away
1 feeling
1 doubly
1 guilty
1 in
1 the
1 discovery
1 of
1 this
1 affliction
1 The
1 thought
1 of
1 it
1 haunted
1 her
1 continually
1 the
1 memory
1 of
1 the
1 lonely
1 girl
1 gave
1 her
1 no
1 peace
1 and
1 a
1 consciousness
1 of
1 deceit
1 burdened
1 her
1 unspeakably
1 especially
1 in
1 Paul
1 s
1 presence
1 This
1 lasted
1 for
1 a
1 week
1 then
1 Lillian
1 resolved
1 to
1 confess
1 hoping
1 that
1 when
1 he
1 found
1 she
1 knew
1 the
1 truth
1 he
1 would
1 let
1 her
1 share
1 his
1 cross
1 and
1 help
1 to
1 lighten
1 it
1 aiting
1 her
1 opportunity
1 she
1 seized
1 a
1 moment
1 when
1 her
1 mother
1 was
1 absent
1 and
1 with
1 her
1 usual
1 frankness
1 spoke
1 out
1 impetuously
1 Paul
1 I
1 ve
1 done
1 wrong
1 and
1 I
1 can
1 have
1 no
1 peace
1 till
1 I
1 am
1 pardoned
1 I
1 have
1 seen
1 Helen
1 here
1 when
1 and
1 how
1 he
1 asked
1 looking
1 disturbed
1 and
1 yet
1 relieved
1 She
1 told
1 him
1 rapidly
1 and
1 as
1 she
1 ended
1 she
1 looked
1 up
1 at
1 him
1 with
1 her
1 sweet
1 face
1 so
1 full
1 of
1 pity
1 shame
1 and
1 grief
1 it
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 impossible
1 to
1 deny
1 her
1 anything
1 Can
1 you
1 forgive
1 me
1 for
1 discovering
1 this
1 affliction
1 I
1 think
1 I
1 could
1 forgive
1 you
1 a
1 far
1 greater
1 fault
1 Lillian
1 he
1 answered
1 in
1 a
1 tone
1 that
1 said
1 many
1 things
1 But
1 deceit
1 is
1 so
1 mean
1 so
1 dishonorable
1 and
1 contemptible
1 how
1 can
1 you
1 so
1 easily
1 pardon
1 it
1 in
1 me
1 she
1 asked
1 quite
1 overcome
1 by
1 this
1 forgiveness
1 granted
1 without
1 any
1 reproach
1 Then
1 you
1 would
1 find
1 it
1 hard
1 to
1 pardon
1 such
1 a
1 thing
1 in
1 another
1 he
1 said
1 with
1 the
1 expression
1 that
1 always
1 puzzled
1 her
1 Yes
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 hard
1 but
1 in
1 those
1 I
1 loved
1 I
1 could
1 forgive
1 much
1 for
1 love
1 s
1 sake
1 ith
1 a
1 sudden
1 gesture
1 he
1 took
1 her
1 hand
1 saying
1 impulsively
1 How
1 little
1 changed
1 you
1 are
1 Do
1 you
1 remember
1 that
1 last
1 ride
1 of
1 ours
1 nearly
1 five
1 years
1 ago
1 Yes
1 Paul
1 she
1 answered
1 with
1 averted
1 eyes
1 And
1 what
1 we
1 talked
1 of
1 A
1 part
1 of
1 that
1 childish
1 gossip
1 I
1 remember
1 well
1 hich
1 part
1 The
1 pretty
1 little
1 romance
1 you
1 told
1 me
1 And
1 Lillian
1 looked
1 up
1 now
1 longing
1 to
1 ask
1 if
1 Helen
1 s
1 childhood
1 had
1 been
1 blighted
1 like
1 her
1 youth
1 Paul
1 dropped
1 her
1 hand
1 as
1 if
1 he
1 read
1 her
1 thoughts
1 and
1 his
1 own
1 hand
1 went
1 involuntarily
1 toward
1 his
1 breast
1 betraying
1 that
1 the
1 locket
1 still
1 hung
1 there
1 hat
1 did
1 I
1 say
1 he
1 asked
1 smiling
1 at
1 her
1 sudden
1 shyness
1 You
1 vowed
1 you
1 d
1 win
1 and
1 wed
1 your
1 fair
1 little
1 lady
1 -love
1 if
1 you
1 lived
1 And
1 so
1 I
1 will
1 he
1 cried
1 with
1 sudden
1 fire
1 in
1 his
1 eyes
1 hat
1 marry
1 her
1 Aye
1 that
1 I
1 will
1 Oh
1 Paul
1 will
1 you
1 tie
1 yourself
1 for
1 life
1 to
1 a
1 -
1 -
1 The
1 word
1 died
1 on
1 her
1 lips
1 but
1 a
1 gesture
1 of
1 repugnance
1 finished
1 the
1 speech
1 A
1 what
1 he
1 demanded
1 excitedly
1 An
1 innocent
1 one
1 bereft
1 of
1 reason
1 stammered
1 Lillian
1 entirely
1 forgetting
1 herself
1 in
1 her
1 interest
1 for
1 him
1 Of
1 whom
1 do
1 you
1 speak
1 asked
1 Paul
1 looking
1 utterly
1 bewildered
1 Of
1 poor
1 Helen
1 Good
1 heavens
1 who
1 told
1 you
1 that
1 base
1 lie
1 And
1 his
1 voice
1 deepened
1 with
1 indignant
1 pain
1 I
1 saw
1 her
1 you
1 did
1 not
1 deny
1 her
1 affliction
1 Hester
1 said
1 so
1 and
1 I
1 believed
1 it
1 Have
1 I
1 wronged
1 her
1 Paul
1 Yes
1 cruelly
1 She
1 is
1 blind
1 but
1 no
1 idiot
1 thank
1 God
1 There
1 was
1 such
1 earnestness
1 in
1 his
1 voice
1 such
1 reproach
1 in
1 his
1 words
1 and
1 such
1 ardor
1 in
1 his
1 eye
1 that
1 Lillian
1 s
1 pride
1 gave
1 way
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 broken
1 entreaty
1 for
1 pardon
1 she
1 covered
1 up
1 her
1 face
1 weeping
1 the
1 bitterest
1 tears
1 she
1 ever
1 shed
1 For
1 in
1 that
1 moment
1 and
1 the
1 sharp
1 pang
1 it
1 brought
1 her
1 she
1 felt
1 how
1 much
1 she
1 loved
1 Paul
1 and
1 how
1 hard
1 it
1 was
1 to
1 lose
1 him
1 The
1 childish
1 affection
1 had
1 blossomed
1 into
1 a
1 woman
1 s
1 passion
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 short
1 weeks
1 had
1 passed
1 through
1 many
1 phases
1 of
1 jealousy
1 hope

1 and

1 -delusion
1 The
1 joy
1 she
1 felt
1 on
1 seeing
1 him
1 again
1 the

1 she
1 took
1 in
1 him
1 the
1 disgust
1 Helen
1 caused
1 her
1 the
1 relief
1 she
1 had
1 not
1 dared
1 to
1 own
1 even
1 to
1 herself
1 when
1 she
1 fancied

1 had
1 put

1 barrier

1 and
1 his
1 cousin
1 the
1 despair
1 at

1 declare

1 to

1 his

1 -

1 In

1 would

1 at

1 by

1 effort
1 murmuring
1 eagerly
1 as

1 shrank
1 from

1 I
1 shall

1 for

1 asked
1 Paul
1 as

1 presented
1 himself
1 at
1 an
1 early
1 hour
1 next
1 day
1 wearing
1 the
1 keen
1 stern
1 expression
1 which

1 ten

1 was
1 No

1 my

1 No

1 And
1 the

1 man
1 s
1 eye
1 kindled
1 as
1 if

1 felt
1 a
1 crisis
1 at

1 Not
1 that
1 I
1 heard
1 sir
1 Miss
1 Lillian
1 took
1 one
1 of

1 the

1 presented
1 the
1 note
1 and
1 retired
1 A
1 few
1 hasty
1 lines
1 from
1 my
1 lady
1 regretting
1 the
1 necessity
1 of
1 this
1 abrupt
1 departure
1 yet
1 giving
1 no

1 for
1 it
1 hoping

1 to

1 at

1 closing
1 with

1 except

1 Paul
1 smiled
1 as
1 he
1 threw
1 it
1 into
1 the
1 fire
1 saying
1 to
1 himself
1 Poor
1 lady
1 she
1 thinks
1 she
1 has
1 escaped
1 the
1 danger
1 by
1 flying
1 and

1 from

1 Tender

1 heart
1 I

1 comfort

1 without

1 He
1 sat
1 looking
1 about
1 the
1 dainty
1 room
1 still
1 full
1 of
1 tokens
1 of
1 her
1 presence
1 The
1 piano
1 stood
1 open
1 with
1 a
1 song
1 he
1 liked
1 upon
1 the
1 rack
1 a
1 bit
1 of
1 embroidery
1 whose

1 often
1 watched
1 lay
1 in

1 with

1 thimble
1 near

1 there
1 was

1 strew
1 of
1 papers
1 on
1 the
1 writing
1 table
1 torn
1 notes
1 scraps
1 of
1 drawing
1 and
1 ball
1 cards
1 a
1 pearl
1 -colored
1 glove
1 lay
1 on
1 the
1 floor
1 and
1 in
1 the
1 grate
1 the
1 faded
1 flowers
1 he
1 had
1 brought
1 two
1 days
1 before
1 As
1 his
1 eye
1 roved
1 to
1 and
1 fro
1 he
1 seemed
1 to
1 enjoy
1 some
1 happy
1 dream
1 broken
1 too
1 soon
1 by
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 servants
1 shutting
1 up
1 the
1 house
1 He
1 arose
1 but
1 lingered
1 near
1 the
1 table
1 as
1 if
1 longing
1 to
1 search
1 for
1 some
1 forgotten
1 hint
1 of
1 himself
1 No
1 there
1 has
1 been
1 enough
1 lock
1 picking
1 and
1 stealthy
1 work
1 I
1 ll
1 do

1 And
1 snatching
1 up
1 the

1 Paul
1 departed
1 Helen
1 the
1 time
1 has
1 come
1 Are
1 you
1 ready
1 he
1 asked
1 entering
1 her
1 room
1 an
1 hour
1 later
1 I
1 am
1 ready
1 And
1 rising
1 she
1 stretched
1 her
1 hand
1 to
1 him
1 with
1 a
1 proud
1 expression
1 contrasting
1 painfully
1 with
1 her
1 helpless
1 gesture
1 They
1 have
1 gone
1 to
1 the
1 Hall
1 and
1 we
1 must
1 follow
1 It
1 is
1 useless
1 to
1 wait
1 longer
1 we
1 gain
1 nothing
1 by
1 it
1 and
1 the
1 claim
1 must
1 stand
1 on
1 such
1 proof
1 as
1 we
1 have
1 or
1 fall
1 for
1 want
1 of
1 that
1 one
1 link
1 I
1 am
1 tired
1 of
1 disguise
1 I
1 want
1 to
1 be
1 myself
1 and
1 enjoy
1 what
1 I
1 have
1 won
1 unless
1 I
1 lose
1 it
1 all
1 Paul
1 whatever
1 happens
1 remember

1 cling
1 together
1 and
1 share
1 good
1 or
1 evil
1 fortune
1 as
1 we
1 always
1 have
1 done
1 I
1 am
1 a
1 burden

1 cannot
1 live
1 without
1 you
1 for
1 you

1 Do
1 not

1 She
1 groped
1 her
1 way
1 to
1 him
1 and
1 clung
1 to
1 his
1 strong
1 arm
1 as
1 if
1 it
1 was
1 her
1 only
1 stay
1 Paul
1 drew
1 her
1 close
1 saying
1 wistfully
1 as
1 he
1 caressed
1 the
1 beautiful
1 sightless
1 face
1 leaning
1 on
1 his
1 shoulder
1 Mia
1 cara
1 would
1 it
1 break
1 your
1 heart
1 if
1 at
1 the
1 last
1 hour
1 I
1 gave
1 up
1 all
1 and
1 let
1 the
1 word
1 remain
1 unspoken
1 My
1 courage
1 fails
1 me
1 and
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 hard
1 past
1 I
1 would
1 gladly
1 leave
1 them
1 in
1 peace
1 No
1 no
1 you
1 shall
1 not
1 give
1 it
1 up
1 cried
1 Helen
1 almost
1 fiercely
1 while
1 the
1 slumbering
1 fire
1 of
1 her
1 southern
1 nature
1 flashed
1 into
1 her
1 face
1 You
1 have
1 waited
1 so
1 long
1 worked
1 so
1 hard
1 suffered
1 so
1 much
1 you
1 must
1 not
1 lose
1 your
1 reward
1 You
1 promised
1 and
1 you
1 must
1 keep
1 the
1 promise
1 But
1 it
1 is
1 so
1 beautiful
1 so
1 noble
1 to
1 forgive
1 and
1 return
1 a
1 blessing
1 for
1 a
1 curse
1 Let
1 us
1 bury
1 the
1 old
1 feud
1 and
1 right
1 the
1 old
1 wrong
1 in
1 a
1 new
1 way
1 Those
1 two
1 are
1 so
1 blameless
1 it
1 is
1 cruel
1 to
1 visit
1 the
1 sins
1 of
1 the
1 dead
1 on
1 their
1 innocent
1 heads
1 My
1 lady
1 has
1 suffered
1 enough
1 already
1 and
1 Lillian
1 is
1 so
1 young
1 so
1 happy
1 so
1 unfit
1 to
1 meet
1 a
1 storm
1 like
1 this
1 Oh
1 Helen
1 mercy
1 is
1 more
1 divine
1 than
1 justice
1 Something
1 moved
1 Paul
1 deeply
1 and
1 Helen
1 seemed
1 about
1 to
1 yield
1 when
1 the
1 name
1 of
1 Lillian
1 wrought
1 a
1 subtle
1 change
1 in
1 her
1 The
1 color
1 died
1 out
1 of
1 her
1 face
1 her
1 black
1 eyes
1 burned
1 with
1 a
1 gloomy
1 fire
1 and
1 her
1 voice
1 was
1 relentless
1 as
1 she
1 answered
1 while
1 her
1 frail
1 hands
1 held
1 him
1 fast
1 I
1 will
1 not
1 let
1 you
1 give
1 it
1 up
1 e
1 are
1 as
1 innocent
1 as
1 they
1 we
1 have
1 suffered
1 more
1 and
1 we
1 deserve
1 our
1 rights
1 for
1 we
1 have
1 no
1 sin
1 to
1 expiate
1 Go
1 on
1 Paul
1 and
1 forget
1 the
1 sentimental
1 folly
1 that
1 unmans
1 you
1 Something
1 in
1 her
1 words
1 seemed
1 to
1 sting
1 or
1 wound
1 him
1 His
1 face
1 darkened
1 and
1 he
1 put
1 her
1 away
1 saying
1 briefly
1 Let
1 it
1 be
1 so
1 then
1 In
1 an
1 hour
1 we
1 must
1 go
1 On
1 the
1 evening
1 of
1 the
1 same
1 day
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 and
1 her
1 daughter
1 sat
1 together
1 in
1 the
1 octagon
1 room
1 at
1 the
1 Hall
1 Twilight
1 was
1 falling
1 and
1 candles
1 were
1 not
1 yet
1 brought
1 but
1 a
1 cheery
1 fire
1 blazed
1 in
1 the
1 wide
1 chimney
1 filling
1 the
1 apartment
1 with
1 a
1 ruddy
1 glow
1 turning
1 Lillian
1 s
1 bright
1 hair
1 to
1 gold
1 and
1 lending
1 a
1 tinge
1 of
1 color
1 to
1 my
1 lady
1 s
1 pallid
1 cheeks
1 The
1 girl
1 sat
1 on
1 a
1 low
1 lounging
1 chair
1 before
1 the
1 fire
1 her
1 head
1 on
1 her
1 hand
1 her
1 eyes
1 on
1 the
1 red
1 embers
1 her
1 thoughts
1 -
1 -where
1 My
1 lady
1 lay
1 on
1 her
1 couch
1 a
1 little
1 in
1 the
1 shadow
1 regarding
1 her
1 daughter
1 with
1 an
1 anxious
1 air
1 for
1 over
1 the
1 young
1 face
1 a
1 somber
1 change
1 had
1 passed
1 which
1 filled
1 her
1 with
1 disquiet
1 You
1 are
1 out
1 of
1 spirits
1 love
1 she
1 said
1 at
1 last
1 breaking
1 the
1 long
1 silence
1 as
1 Lillian
1 gave
1 an
1 unconscious
1 sigh
1 and
1 leaned
1 wearily
1 into
1 the
1 depths
1 of
1 her
1 chair
1 Yes
1 Mamma
1 a
1 little
1 hat
1 is
1 it
1 Are
1 you
1 ill
1 No
1 Mamma
1 I
1 think
1 London
1 gaiety
1 is
1 rather
1 too
1 much
1 for
1 me
1 I
1 m
1 too
1 young
1 for
1 it
1 as
1 you
1 often
1 say
1 and
1 I
1 ve
1 found
1 it
1 out
1 Then
1 it
1 is
1 only
1 weariness
1 that
1 makes
1 you
1 so
1 pale
1 and
1 grave
1 and
1 so
1 bent
1 on
1 coming
1 back
1 here
1 Lillian
1 was
1 the
1 soul
1 of
1 truth
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 moment
1 s
1 hesitation
1 answered
1 slowly
1 Not
1 that
1 alone
1 Mamma
1 I
1 m
1 worried
1 about
1 other
1 things
1 Don
1 t
1 ask
1 me
1 what
1 please
1 But
1 I
1 must
1 ask
1 Tell
1 me
1 child
1 what
1 things
1 Have
1 you
1 seen
1 any
1 one
1 Had
1 letters
1 or
1 been
1 annoyed
1 in
1 any
1 way
1 about
1 -
1 -anything
1 My
1 lady
1 spoke
1 with
1 sudden
1 energy
1 and
1 rose
1 on
1 her
1 arm
1 eyeing
1 the
1 girl
1 with
1 unmistakable
1 suspicion
1 and
1 excitement
1 No
1 Mamma
1 it
1 s
1 only
1 a
1 foolish
1 trouble
1 of
1 my
1 own
1 answered
1 Lillian
1 with
1 a
1 glance
1 of
1 surprise
1 and
1 a
1 shamefaced
1 look
1 as
1 the
1 words
1 reluctantly
1 left
1 her
1 lips
1 Ah
1 a
1 love
1 trouble
1 nothing
1 more
1 Thank
1 God
1 for
1 that
1 And
1 my
1 lady
1 sank
1 back
1 as
1 if
1 a
1 load
1 was
1 off
1 her
1 mind
1 Tell
1 me
1 all
1 my
1 darling
1 there
1 is
1 no
1 confidante
1 like
1 a
1 mother
1 You
1 are
1 very
1 kind
1 and
1 perhaps
1 you
1 can
1 cure
1 my
1 folly
1 if
1 I
1 tell
1 it
1 and
1 yet
1 I
1 am
1 ashamed
1 murmured
1 the
1 girl
1 Then
1 yielding
1 to
1 an
1 irresistible
1 impulse
1 to
1 ask
1 help
1 and
1 sympathy
1 she
1 added
1 in
1 an
1 almost
1 inaudible
1 tone
1 I
1 came
1 away
1 to
1 escape
1 from
1 Paul
1 Because
1 he
1 loves
1 you
1 Lillian
1 asked
1 my
1 lady
1 with
1 a
1 frown
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 smile
1 Because
1 he
1 does
1 not
1 love
1 me
1 Mamma
1 And
1 the
1 poor
1 girl
1 hid
1 her
1 burning
1 cheeks
1 in
1 her
1 hands
1 as
1 if
1 overwhelmed
1 with
1 maidenly
1 shame
1 at
1 the
1 implied
1 confession
1 of
1 her
1 own
1 affection
1 My
1 child
1 how
1 is
1 this
1 I
1 cannot
1 but
1 be
1 glad
1 that
1 he
1 does
1 not
1 love
1 you
1 yet
1 it
1 fills
1 me
1 with
1 grief
1 to
1 see
1 that
1 this
1 pains
1 you
1 He
1 is
1 not
1 a
1 mate
1 for
1 you
1 Lillian
1 Remember
1 this
1 and
1 forget
1 the
1 transient
1 regard
1 that
1 has
1 sprung
1 up
1 from
1 that
1 early
1 intimacy
1 of
1 yours
1 He
1 is
1 wellborn
1 and
1 now
1 my
1 equal
1 in
1 fortune
1 and
1 oh
1 so
1 much
1 my
1 superior
1 in
1 all
1 gifts
1 of
1 mind
1 and
1 heart
1 sighed
1 the
1 girl
1 still
1 with
1 hidden
1 face
1 for
1 tears
1 were
1 dropping
1 through
1 her
1 slender
1 fingers
1 It
1 may
1 be
1 but
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 mystery
1 about
1 him
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 vague
1 dislike
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 all
1 that
1 has
1 passed
1 But
1 darling
1 are
1 you
1 sure
1 he
1 does
1 not
1 care
1 for
1 you
1 I
1 fancied
1 I
1 read
1 a
1 different
1 story
1 in
1 his
1 face
1 and
1 when
1 you
1 begged
1 to
1 leave
1 town
1 so
1 suddenly
1 I
1 believed
1 that
1 you
1 had
1 seen
1 this
1 also
1 and
1 kindly
1 wished
1 to
1 spare
1 him
1 any
1 pain
1 It
1 was
1 to
1 spare
1 myself
1 Oh
1 Mamma
1 he
1 loves
1 Helen
1 and
1 will
1 marry
1 her
1 although
1 she
1 is
1 blind
1 He
1 told
1 me
1 this
1 with
1 a
1 look
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 doubt
1 and
1 so
1 I
1 came
1 away
1 to
1 hide
1 my
1 sorrow
1 sobbed
1 poor
1 Lillian
1 in
1 despair
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 went
1 to
1 her
1 and
1 laying
1 the
1 bright
1 head
1 on
1 her
1 motherly
1 bosom
1 said
1 soothingly
1 as
1 she
1 caressed
1 it
1 My
1 little
1 girl
1 it
1 is
1 too
1 soon
1 for
1 you
1 to
1 know
1 these
1 troubles
1 and
1 I
1 am
1 punished
1 for
1 yielding
1 to
1 your
1 entreaties
1 for
1 a
1 peep
1 at
1 the
1 gay
1 world
1 It
1 is
1 now
1 too
1 late
1 to
1 spare
1 you
1 this
1 you
1 have
1 had
1 your
1 wish
1 and
1 must
1 pay
1 its
1 price
1 dear
1 But
1 Lillian
1 call
1 pride
1 to
1 aid
1 you
1 and
1 conquer
1 this
1 fruitless
1 love
1 It
1 cannot
1 be
1 very
1 deep
1 as
1 yet
1 for
1 you
1 have
1 known
1 Paul
1 the
1 man
1 too
1 short
1 a
1 time
1 to
1 be
1 hopelessly
1 enamored
1 Remember
1 there
1 are
1 others
1 better
1 braver
1 more
1 worthy
1 of
1 you
1 that
1 life
1 is
1 long
1 and
1 full
1 of
1 pleasure
1 yet
1 untried
1 Have
1 no
1 fears
1 for
1 me
1 Mamma
1 I
1 ll
1 not
1 disgrace
1 you
1 or
1 myself
1 by
1 any
1 sentimental
1 folly
1 I
1 do
1 love
1 Paul
1 but
1 I
1 can
1 conquer
1 it
1 and
1 I
1 will
1 Give
1 me
1 a
1 little
1 time
1 and
1 you
1 shall
1 see
1 me
1 quite
1 myself
1 again
1 Lillian
1 lifted
1 her
1 head
1 with
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 proud
1 resolve
1 that
1 satisfied
1 her
1 mother
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 grateful
1 kiss
1 stole
1 away
1 to
1 ease
1 her
1 full
1 heart
1 alone
1 As
1 she
1 disappeared
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 drew
1 a
1 long
1 breath
1 and
1 clasping
1 her
1 hands
1 with
1 a
1 gesture
1 of
1 thanksgiving
1 murmured
1 to
1 herself
1 in
1 an
1 accent
1 of
1 relief
1 Only
1 a
1 love
1 sorrow
1 I
1 feared
1 it
1 was
1 some
1 new
1 terror
1 like
1 the
1 old
1 one
1 Seventeen
1 years
1 of
1 silence
1 seventeen
1 years
1 of
1 secret
1 dread
1 and
1 remorse
1 for
1 me
1 she
1 said
1 pacing
1 the
1 room
1 with
1 tightly
1 locked
1 hands
1 and
1 eyes
1 full
1 of
1 unspeakable
1 anguish
1 Oh
1 Richard
1 Richard
1 I
1 forgave
1 you
1 long
1 ago
1 and
1 surely
1 I
1 have
1 expiated
1 my
1 innocent
1 offense
1 by
1 these
1 years
1 of
1 suffering
1 For
1 her
1 sake
1 I
1 did
1 it
1 and
1 for
1 her
1 sake
1 I
1 still
1 keep
1 dumb
1 God
1 knows
1 I
1 ask
1 nothing
1 for
1 myself
1 but
1 rest
1 and
1 oblivion
1 by
1 your
1 side
1 Half
1 an
1 hour
1 later
1 Paul
1 stood
1 at
1 the
1 hall
1 door
1 It
1 was
1 ajar
1 for
1 the
1 family
1 had
1 returned
1 unexpectedly
1 as
1 was
1 evident
1 from
1 the
1 open
1 doors
1 and
1 empty
1 halls
1 Entering
1 unseen
1 he
1 ascended
1 to
1 the
1 room
1 my
1 lady
1 usually
1 occupied
1 The
1 fire
1 burned
1 low
1 Lillian
1 s
1 chair
1 was
1 empty
1 and
1 my
1 lady
1 lay
1 asleep
1 as
1 if
1 lulled
1 by
1 the
1 sighing
1 winds
1 without
1 and
1 the
1 deep
1 silence
1 that
1 reigned
1 within
1 Paul
1 stood
1 regarding
1 her
1 with
1 a
1 great
1 pity
1 softening
1 his
1 face
1 as
1 he
1 marked
1 the
1 sunken
1 eyes
1 pallid
1 cheeks
1 locks
1 too
1 early
1 gray
1 and
1 restless
1 lips
1 muttering
1 in
1 dreams
1 I
1 wish
1 I
1 could
1 spare
1 her
1 this
1 he
1 sighed
1 stooping
1 to
1 wake
1 her
1 with
1 a
1 word
1 But
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 speak
1 for
1 suddenly
1 clutching
1 the
1 chain
1 about
1 her
1 neck
1 she
1 seemed
1 to
1 struggle
1 with
1 some
1 invisible
1 foe
1 and
1 beat
1 it
1 off
1 muttering
1 audibly
1 as
1 she
1 clenched
1 her
1 thin
1 hands
1 on
1 the
1 golden
1 case
1 Paul
1 leaned
1 and
1 listened
1 as
1 if
1 the
1 first
1 word
1 had
1 turned
1 him
1 to
1 stone
1 till
1 the
1 paroxysm
1 had
1 passed
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 heavy
1 sigh
1 my
1 lady
1 sank
1 into
1 a
1 calmer
1 sleep
1 Then
1 with
1 a
1 quick
1 glance
1 over
1 his
1 shoulder
1 Paul
1 skillfully
1 opened
1 the
1 locket
1 drew
1 out
1 the
1 silver
1 key
1 replaced
1 it
1 with
1 one
1 from
1 the
1 piano
1 close
1 by
1 and
1 stole
1 from
1 the
1 house
1 noiselessly
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 entered
1 it
1 That
1 night
1 in
1 the
1 darkest
1 hour
1 before
1 the
1 dawn
1 a
1 figure
1 went
1 gliding
1 through
1 the
1 shadowy
1 Park
1 to
1 its
1 most
1 solitary
1 corner
1 Here
1 stood
1 the
1 tomb
1 of
1 the
1 Trevlyns
1 and
1 here
1 the
1 figure
1 paused
1 A
1 dull
1 spark
1 of
1 light
1 woke
1 in
1 its
1 hand
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 clank
1 of
1 bars
1 the
1 creak
1 of
1 rusty
1 hinges
1 then
1 light
1 and
1 figure
1 both
1 seemed
1 swallowed
1 up
1 Standing
1 in
1 the
1 tomb
1 where
1 the
1 air
1 was
1 close
1 and
1 heavy
1 the
1 pale
1 glimmer
1 of
1 the
1 lantern
1 showed
1 piles
1 of
1 moldering
1 coffins
1 in
1 the
1 niches
1 and
1 everywhere
1 lay
1 tokens
1 of
1 decay
1 and
1 death
1 The
1 man
1 drew
1 his
1 hat
1 lower
1 over
1 his
1 eyes
1 pulled
1 the
1 muffler
1 closer
1 about
1 his
1 mouth
1 and
1 surveyed
1 the
1 spot
1 with
1 an
1 undaunted
1 aspect
1 though
1 the
1 beating
1 of
1 his
1 heart
1 was
1 heard
1 in
1 the
1 deep
1 silence
1 Nearest
1 the
1 door
1 stood
1 a
1 long
1 casket
1 covered
1 with
1 black
1 velvet
1 and
1 richly
1 decorated
1 with
1 silver
1 ornaments
1 tarnished
1 now
1 The
1 Trevlyns
1 had
1 been
1 a

1 Lillian
1 stood
1 beside

1 and
1 saw
1 the
1 line
1 Their
1 eyes
1 met
1 and
1 in
1 the
1 girl
1 s
1 face
1 was
1 such
1 a
1 sudden
1 glow
1 of
1 hope
1 and
1 love
1 and
1 longing
1 that
1 the
1 mother
1 could
1 not

1 I
1 will
1 see

1 said
1 Oh
1 Mamma
1 how
1 kind
1 you

1 cried
1 the
1 girl
1 with
1 a

1 embrace
1 adding
1 breathlessly
1 He

1 I

1 I

1 They
1 were
1 in
1 the
1 library
1 for

1 for
1 the
1 room
1 which
1 held
1 no

1 memories
1 for
1 her
1 my
1 lady
1 conquered
1 her
1 dislike
1 and
1 often
1 sat
1 there
1 As
1 she
1 spoke
1 the
1 girl
1 glided
1 into
1 the
1 deep
1 recess
1 of
1 a
1 bay
1 window
1 and
1 drew
1 the
1 heavy
1 curtains
1 just
1 as
1 Paul
1 s
1 step
1 sounded
1 at
1 the
1 door
1 Hiding

1 with
1 a
1 woman
1 s

1 my
1 lady
1 rose
1 with
1 outstretched
1 hand
1 to
1 welcome
1 him
1 He
1 bowed
1 but
1 did
1 not
1 take
1 the
1 hand
1 saying
1 in
1 a
1 voice
1 of
1 grave
1 respect
1 in
1 which
1 was
1 audible
1 an
1 undertone
1 of
1 strong
1 emotion
1 Pardon
1 me
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 Hear
1 what
1 I
1 have
1 to

1 and
1 then
1 if
1 you
1 offer
1 me
1 your
1 hand
1 I
1 shall
1 gratefully
1 receive
1 it
1 She
1 glanced
1 at
1 him
1 and
1 saw
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 very
1 pale
1 that
1 his
1 eye
1 glittered
1 with
1 suppressed
1 excitement
1 and
1 his
1 whole
1 manner
1 was
1 that
1 of
1 a
1 man
1 who
1 had
1 nerved
1 himself
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 performance
1 of
1 a
1 difficult
1 but
1 intensely
1 interesting
1 task
1 Fancying
1 these
1 signs
1 of
1 agitation
1 only
1 natural
1 in
1 a
1 young
1 lover
1 coming
1 to
1 woo
1 my
1 lady
1 smiled
1 reseated
1 herself
1 and
1 calmly
1 answered
1 I
1 will
1 listen
1 patiently
1 Speak
1 freely
1 Paul
1 and
1 remember
1 I
1 am
1 an
1 old
1 friend
1 I
1 wish
1 I
1 could
1 forget
1 it
1 Then
1 my
1 task
1 would
1 be
1 easier
1 he
1 murmured
1 in
1 a
1 voice
1 of
1 mingled
1 regret
1 and
1 resolution
1 as
1 he
1 leaned
1 on
1 a
1 tall
1 chair
1 opposite
1 and
1 wiped
1 his
1 damp
1 forehead
1 with
1 a
1 look
1 of
1 such
1 deep
1 compassion
1 that
1 her
1 heart
1 sank
1 with
1 a
1 nameless
1 fear
1 I
1 must
1 tell
1 you
1 a
1 long
1 story
1 and
1 ask
1 your
1 forgiveness
1 for
1 the
1 offenses
1 I
1 committed
1 against
1 you
1 when
1 a
1 boy
1 A
1 mistaken
1 sense
1 of
1 duty
1 guided
1 me
1 and
1 I
1 obeyed
1 it
1 blindly
1 Now
1 I
1 see
1 my
1 error
1 and
1 regret
1 it
1 he
1 said
1 earnestly
1 Go
1 on
1 replied
1 my
1 lady
1 while
1 the
1 vague
1 dread
1 grew
1 stronger
1 and
1 she
1 braced
1 her
1 nerves
1 as
1 for
1 some
1 approaching
1 shock
1 She
1 forgot
1 Lillian
1 forgot
1 everything
1 but
1 the
1 strange
1 aspect
1 of
1 the
1 man
1 before
1 her
1 and
1 the
1 words
1 to
1 which
1 she
1 listened
1 like
1 a
1 statue
1 Still
1 standing
1 pale
1 and
1 steady
1 Paul
1 spoke
1 rapidly
1 while
1 his
1 eyes
1 were
1 full
1 of
1 mingled
1 sternness
1 pity
1 and
1 remorse
1 Twenty
1 years
1 ago
1 an
1 English
1 gentleman
1 met
1 a
1 friend
1 in
1 a
1 little
1 Italian
1 town
1 where
1 he
1 had
1 married
1 a
1 beautiful
1 wife
1 The
1 wife
1 had
1 a
1 sister
1 as
1 lovely
1 as
1 herself
1 and
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 during
1 that
1 brief
1 stay
1 loved
1 and
1 married
1 her
1 -
1 -in
1 a
1 very
1 private
1 manner
1 lest
1 his
1 father
1 should
1 disinherit
1 him
1 A
1 few
1 months
1 passed
1 and
1 the
1 Englishman
1 was
1 called
1 home
1 to
1 take
1 possession
1 of
1 his
1 title
1 and
1 estates
1 the
1 father
1 being
1 dead
1 He
1 went
1 alone
1 promising
1 to
1 send
1 for
1 the
1 wife
1 when
1 all
1 was
1 ready
1 He
1 told
1 no
1 one
1 of
1 his
1 marriage
1 meaning
1 to
1 surprise
1 his
1 English
1 friends
1 by
1 producing
1 the
1 lovely
1 woman
1 unexpectedly
1 He
1 had
1 been
1 in
1 England
1 but
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 when
1 he
1 received
1 a
1 letter
1 from
1 the
1 old
1 priest
1 of
1 the
1 Italian
1 town
1 saying
1 the
1 cholera
1 had
1 swept
1 through
1 it
1 carrying
1 off
1 half
1 its
1 inhabitants
1 his
1 wife
1 and
1 friend
1 among
1 others
1 This
1 blow
1 prostrated
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 and
1 when
1 he
1 recovered
1 he
1 hid
1 his
1 grief
1 shut
1 himself
1 up
1 in
1 his
1 country
1 house
1 and
1 tried
1 to
1 forget
1 Accident
1 threw
1 in
1 his
1 way
1 another
1 lovely
1 woman
1 and
1 he
1 married
1 again
1 Before
1 the
1 first
1 year
1 was
1 out
1 the
1 friend
1 whom
1 he
1 supposed
1 was
1 dead
1 appeared
1 and
1 told
1 him
1 that
1 his
1 wife
1 still
1 lived
1 and
1 had
1 borne
1 him
1 a
1 child
1 In
1 the
1 terror
1 and
1 confusion
1 of
1 the
1 plague
1 the
1 priest
1 had
1 mistaken
1 one
1 sister
1 for
1 the
1 other
1 as
1 the
1 elder
1 did
1 die
1 Yes
1 yes
1 I
1 know
1 go
1 on
1 gasped
1 my
1 lady
1 with
1 white
1 lips
1 and
1 eyes
1 that
1 never
1 left
1 the
1 narrator
1 s
1 face
1 This
1 friend
1 had
1 met
1 with
1 misfortune
1 after
1 flying
1 from
1 the
1 doomed
1 village
1 with
1 the
1 surviving
1 sister
1 They
1 had
1 waited
1 long
1 for
1 letters
1 had
1 written
1 and
1 when
1 no
1 answer
1 came
1 had
1 been
1 delayed
1 by
1 illness
1 and
1 poverty
1 from
1 reaching
1 England
1 At
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 child
1 was
1 born
1 and
1 the
1 friend
1 urged
1 by
1 the
1 wife
1 and
1 his
1 own
1 interest
1 came
1 here
1 learned
1 that
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 was
1 married
1 and
1 hurried
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 much
1 distress
1 e
1 can
1 imagine
1 the
1 grief
1 and
1 horror
1 of
1 the
1 unhappy
1 man
1 In
1 that
1 interview
1 the
1 friend
1 promised
1 to
1 leave
1 all
1 to
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 to
1 preserve
1 the
1 secret
1 till
1 some
1 means
1 of
1 relief
1 could
1 be
1 found
1 and
1 with
1 this
1 promise
1 he
1 returned
1 to
1 guard
1 and
1 comfort
1 the
1 forsaken
1 wife
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 wrote
1 the
1 truth
1 to
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 meaning
1 to
1 kill
1 himself
1 as
1 the
1 only
1 way
1 of
1 escape
1 from
1 the
1 terrible
1 situation
1 between
1 two
1 women
1 both
1 so
1 beloved
1 both
1 so
1 innocently
1 wronged
1 The
1 pistol
1 lay
1 ready
1 but
1 death
1 came
1 without
1 its
1 aid
1 and
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 was
1 spared
1 the
1 sin
1 of
1 suicide
1 Paul
1 paused
1 for
1 breath
1 but
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 motioned
1 him
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 still
1 sitting
1 rigid
1 and
1 white
1 as
1 the
1 marble
1 image
1 near
1 her
1 The
1 friend
1 only
1 lived
1 to
1 reach
1 home
1 and
1 tell
1 the
1 story
1 It
1 killed
1 the
1 wife
1 and
1 she
1 died
1 imploring
1 the
1 old
1 priest
1 to
1 see
1 her
1 child
1 righted
1 and
1 its
1 father
1 s
1 name
1 secured
1 to
1 it
1 He
1 promised
1 but
1 he
1 was
1 poor
1 the
1 child
1 was
1 a
1 frail
1 baby
1 and
1 he
1 waited
1 Years
1 passed
1 and
1 when
1 the
1 child
1 was
1 old
1 enough
1 to
1 ask
1 for
1 its
1 parents
1 and
1 demand
1 its
1 due
1 the
1 proofs
1 of
1 the
1 marriage
1 were
1 lost
1 and
1 nothing
1 remained
1 but
1 a
1 ring
1 a
1 bit
1 of
1 writing
1 and
1 the
1 name
1 The
1 priest
1 was
1 very
1 old
1 had
1 neither
1 friends
1 money
1 nor
1 proofs
1 to
1 help
1 him
1 but
1 I
1 was
1 strong
1 and
1 hopeful
1 and
1 though
1 a
1 mere
1 boy
1 I
1 resolved
1 to
1 do
1 the
1 work
1 I
1 made
1 my
1 way
1 to
1 England
1 to
1 Trevlyn
1 Hall
1 and
1 by
1 various
1 stratagems
1 among
1 which
1 I
1 am
1 ashamed
1 to
1 say
1 were
1 false
1 keys
1 and
1 feigned
1 sleepwalking
1 I
1 collected
1 many
1 proofs
1 but
1 nothing
1 which
1 would
1 satisfy
1 a
1 court
1 for
1 no
1 one
1 but
1 you
1 knew
1 where
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 confession
1 was
1 I
1 searched
1 every
1 nook
1 and
1 corner
1 of
1 the
1 Hall
1 but
1 in
1 vain
1 and
1 began
1 to
1 despair
1 when
1 news
1 of
1 the
1 death
1 of
1 Father
1 Cosmo
1 recalled
1 me
1 to
1 Italy
1 for
1 Helen
1 was
1 left
1 to
1 my
1 care
1 then
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 had
1 faithfully
1 recorded
1 the
1 facts
1 and
1 left
1 witnesses
1 to
1 prove
1 the
1 truth
1 of
1 his
1 story
1 but
1 for
1 four
1 years
1 I
1 never
1 used
1 it
1 never
1 made
1 any
1 effort
1 to
1 secure
1 the
1 title
1 or
1 estates
1 hy
1 not
1 breathed
1 my
1 lady
1 in
1 a
1 faint
1 whisper
1 as
1 hope
1 suddenly
1 revived
1 Because
1 I
1 was
1 grateful
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 first
1 time
1 Paul
1 s
1 voice
1 faltered
1 I
1 was
1 a
1 stranger
1 and
1 you
1 took
1 me
1 in
1 I
1 never
1 could
1 forget
1 that
1 nor
1 tie
1 many
1 kindnesses
1 bestowed
1 upon
1 the
1 friendless
1 boy
1 This
1 afflicted
1 me
1 even
1 while
1 I
1 was
1 acting
1 a
1 false
1 part
1 and
1 when
1 I
1 was
1 away
1 my
1 heart
1 failed
1 me
1 But
1 Helen
1 gave
1 me
1 no
1 peace
1 for
1 my
1 sake
1 she
1 urged
1 me
1 to
1 keep
1 the
1 vow
1 made
1 to
1 that
1 poor
1 mother
1 and
1 threatened
1 to
1 tell
1 the
1 story
1 herself
1 Talbot
1 s
1 benefaction
1 left
1 me
1 no
1 excuse
1 for
1 delaying
1 longer
1 and
1 I
1 came
1 to
1 finish
1 the
1 hardest
1 task
1 I
1 can
1 ever
1 undertake
1 I
1 feared
1 that
1 a
1 long
1 dispute
1 would
1 follow
1 any
1 appeal
1 to
1 law
1 and
1 meant
1 to
1 appeal
1 first
1 to
1 you
1 but
1 fate
1 befriended
1 me
1 and
1 the
1 last
1 proof
1 was
1 found
1 Found
1 here
1 cried
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 springing
1 up
1 aghast
1 In
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 coffin
1 where
1 you
1 hid
1 it
1 not
1 daring
1 to
1 destroy
1 yet
1 fearing
1 to
1 keep
1 it
1 ho
1 has
1 betrayed
1 me
1 And
1 her
1 eye
1 glanced
1 wildly
1 about
1 the
1 room
1 as
1 if
1 she
1 feared
1 to
1 see
1 some
1 spectral
1 accuser
1 Your
1 own
1 lips
1 my
1 lady
1 Last
1 night
1 I
1 came
1 to
1 speak
1 of
1 this
1 You
1 lay
1 asleep
1 and
1 in
1 some
1 troubled
1 dream
1 spoke
1 of
1 the
1 paper
1 safe
1 in
1 its
1 writer
1 s
1 keeping
1 and
1 your
1 strange
1 treasure
1 here
1 the
1 key
1 of
1 which
1 you
1 guarded
1 day
1 and
1 night
1 I
1 divined
1 the
1 truth
1 Remembering
1 Hester
1 s
1 stories
1 I
1 took
1 the
1 key
1 from
1 your
1 helpless
1 hand
1 found
1 the
1 paper
1 on
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 dead
1 breast
1 and
1 now
1 demand
1 that
1 you
1 confess
1 your
1 part
1 in
1 this
1 tragedy
1 I
1 do
1 I
1 do
1 I
1 confess
1 I
1 yield
1 I
1 relinquish
1 everything
1 and
1 ask
1 pity
1 only
1 for
1 my
1 child
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 fell
1 upon
1 her
1 knees
1 before
1 him
1 with
1 a
1 submissive
1 gesture
1 but
1 imploring
1 eyes
1 for
1 amid
1 the
1 wreck
1 of
1 womanly
1 pride
1 and
1 worldly
1 fortune
1 the

1 I
1 God
1 knows
1 I
1 would

1 this
1 blow
1 if

1 but
1 Helen
1 would

1 and
1 I
1 was
1 driven
1 to

1 I
1 had

1 Tell
1 Lillian
1 this
1 and

1 not

1 As
1 Paul
1 spoke
1 tenderly
1 eagerly
1 the
1 curtain
1 parted
1 and
1 Lillian
1 appeared
1 trembling
1 with
1 the
1 excitement
1 of
1 that
1 interview
1 but
1 conscious
1 of
1 only
1 one
1 emotion
1 as

1 threw

1 into

1 crying
1 in
1 a

1 of

1 delight
1 Brother
1 Brother
1 Now
1 I
1 may

1 you
1 Paul
1 held
1 her
1 close
1 and
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 forgot
1 everything
1 but
1 the
1 joy
1 of
1 that
1 moment
1 Lillian
1 spoke
1 first
1 looking
1 up
1 through
1 tears
1 of
1 tenderness
1 her
1 little
1 hand
1 laid
1 caressingly
1 against
1 his
1 cheek
1 as
1 she
1 whispered
1 with
1 sudden
1 bloom
1 in
1 her
1 own
1 Now
1 I
1 know
1 why
1 I
1 loved
1 you
1 so
1 well
1 and
1 now
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 you
1 marry
1 Helen
1 without
1 breaking
1 my
1 heart
1 Oh
1 Paul
1 you
1 are
1 still
1 mine
1 and
1 I
1 care
1 for
1 nothing

1 But
1 Lillian
1 I
1 am
1 not
1 your
1 brother
1 Then
1 in

1 s
1 name
1 who
1 are
1 you
1 she
1 cried
1 tearing
1 herself
1 from
1 his
1 arms
1 Your
1 lover
1 dear
1 ho
1 then
1 is
1 the
1 heir
1 demanded
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 springing
1 up
1 as
1 Lillian
1 turned
1 to
1 seek
1 shelter
1 with
1 her
1 mother
1 I
1 am
1 Helen
1 spoke
1 and
1 Helen
1 stood
1 on
1 the
1 threshold
1 of
1 the
1 door
1 with
1 a
1 hard
1 haughty
1 look
1 upon
1 her
1 beautiful
1 face
1 You
1 told
1 your
1 story
1 badly
1 Paul
1 she
1 said
1 in
1 a
1 bitter
1 tone
1 You
1 forgot
1 me
1 forgot
1 my
1 affliction
1 my
1 loneliness
1 my
1 wrongs
1 and
1 the
1 natural
1 desire
1 of
1 a
1 child
1 to
1 clear
1 her
1 mother
1 s
1 honor
1 and
1 claim
1 her
1 father
1 s
1 name
1 I
1 am
1 Sir
1 Richard
1 s
1 eldest
1 daughter
1 I
1 can
1 prove
1 my

1 and
1 I
1 demand
1 my
1 right
1 with
1 his
1 own
1 words
1 to
1 sustain
1 me
1 She
1 paused
1 but
1 no
1 one
1 spoke
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 slight
1 tremor
1 in
1 her
1 proud
1 voice
1 she
1 added
1 Paul
1 has
1 done
1 the
1 work
1 he
1 shall
1 have
1 the
1 reward
1 I
1 only
1 want
1 my
1 father
1 s
1 name
1 Title
1 and
1 fortune
1 are
1 nothing
1 to
1 one
1 like
1 me
1 I
1 coveted
1 and
1 claimed
1 them
1 that
1 I
1 might
1 give
1 them
1 to
1 you
1 Paul
1 my
1 one
1 friend
1 always
1 so
1 tender
1 and
1 so
1 true
1 I
1 ll
1 have
1 none
1 of
1 it
1 he
1 answered
1 almost
1 fiercely
1 I
1 have
1 kept
1 my
1 promise
1 and
1 am
1 free
1 You
1 chose
1 to
1 claim
1 your
1 own
1 although
1 I
1 offered
1 all
1 I
1 had
1 to
1 buy
1 your
1 silence
1 It
1 is
1 yours
1 by
1 right
1 -
1 -take
1 it
1 and
1 enjoy
1 it
1 if
1 you
1 can
1 I
1 ll
1 have
1 no
1 reward
1 for
1 work
1 like
1 this
1 He
1 turned
1 from
1 her
1 with
1 a
1 look
1 that
1 would
1 have
1 stricken
1 her
1 to
1 the
1 heart
1 could
1 she
1 have
1 seen
1 it
1 She
1 felt
1 it
1 and
1 it
1 seemed
1 to
1 augment
1 some
1 secret
1 anguish
1 for
1 she
1 pressed
1 her
1 hands
1 against
1 her
1 bosom
1 with
1 an
1 expression
1 of
1 deep
1 suffering
1 exclaiming
1 passionately
1 Yes
1 I
1 will
1 keep
1 it
1 since
1 I
1 am
1 to
1 lose
1 all
1 else
1 I
1 am
1 tired
1 of
1 pity
1 Power
1 is
1 sweet
1 and
1 I
1 will
1 use
1 it
1 Go
1 Paul
1 and
1 be
1 happy
1 if
1 you
1 can
1 with
1 a
1 nameless
1 wife
1 and
1 the
1 world
1 s
1 compassion
1 or
1 contempt
1 to
1 sting
1 your
1 pride
1 Oh
1 Lillian
1 where
1 shall
1 we
1 go
1 This
1 is
1 no
1 longer
1 our
1 home
1 but
1 who
1 will
1 receive
1 us
1 now
1 cried
1 Lady
1 Trevlyn
1 in
1 a
1 tone
1 of
1 despair
1 for
1 her
1 spirit
1 was
1 utterly
1 broken
1 by
1 the
1 thought
1 of
1 the
1 shame
1 and
1 sorrow
1 in
1 store
1 for
1 this
1 beloved
1 and
1 innocent
1 child
1 I
1 will
1 And
1 Paul
1 s
1 face
1 shone
1 with
1 a
1 love
1 and
1 loyalty
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 doubt
1 My
1 lady
1 you
1 gave
1 me
1 a
1 home
1 when
1 I
1 was
1 homeless
1 now
1 let
1 me
1 pay
1 my
1 debt
1 Lillian
1 I
1 have
1 loved
1 you
1 from
1 the
1 time
1 when
1 a
1 romantic
1 boy
1 I
1 wore
1 your
1 little
1 picture
1 in
1 my
1 breast
1 and
1 vowed
1 to
1 win
1 you
1 if
1 I
1 lived
1 I
1 dared
1 not
1 speak
1 before
1 but
1 now
1 when
1 other
1 hearts
1 may
1 be
1 shut
1 against
1 you
1 mine
1 stands
1 wide
1 open
1 to
1 welcome
1 you
1 Come
1 both
1 Let
1 me
1 protect
1 and
1 cherish
1 you
1 and
1 so
1 atone
1 for
1 the
1 sorrow
1 I
1 have
1 brought
1 you
1 It
1 was
1 impossible
1 to
1 resist
1 the
1 sincere
1 urgency
1 of
1 his
1 voice
1 the
1 tender
1 reverence
1 of
1 his
1 manner
1 as
1 he
1 took
1 the
1 two
1 forlorn
1 yet
1 innocent
1 creatures
1 into
1 the
1 shelter
1 of
1 his
1 strength
1 and
1 love
1 They
1 clung
1 to
1 him
1 instinctively
1 feeling
1 that
1 there
1 still
1 remained
1 to
1 them
1 one
1 staunch
1 friend
1 whom
1 adversity
1 could
1 not
1 estrange
1 An
1 eloquent
1 silence
1 fell
1 upon
1 the
1 room
1 broken
1 only
1 by
1 sobs
1 grateful
1 whispers
1 and
1 the
1 voiceless
1 vows
1 that
1 lovers
1 plight
1 with
1 eyes
1 and
1 hands
1 and
1 tender
1 lips
1 Helen
1 was
1 forgotten
1 till
1 Lillian
1 whose
1 elastic
1 spirit
1 threw
1 off
1 sorrow
1 as
1 a
1 flower
1 sheds
1 the
1 rain
1 looked
1 up
1 to
1 thank
1 Paul
1 with
1 smiles
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 tears
1 and
1 saw
1 the
1 lonely
1 figure
1 in
1 the
1 shadow
1 Her
1 attitude
1 was
1 full
1 of
1 pathetic
1 significance
1 she
1 still
1 stood
1 on
1 the
1 threshold
1 for
1 no
1 one
1 had
1 welcomed
1 her
1 and
1 in
1 the
1 strange
1 room
1 she
1 knew
1 not
1 where
1 to
1 go
1 her
1 hands
1 were
1 clasped
1 before
1 her
1 face
1 as
1 if
1 those
1 sightless
1 eyes
1 had
1 seen
1 the
1 joy
1 she
1 could
1 not
1 share
1 and
1 at
1 her
1 feet
1 lay
1 the
1 time
1 -stained
1 paper
1 that
1 gave
1 her
1 a
1 barren
1 title
1 but
1 no
1 love
1 Had
1 Lillian
1 known
1 how
1 sharp
1 a
1 conflict
1 between
1 passion
1 and
1 pride
1 jealousy
1 and
1 generosity
1 was
1 going
1 on
1 in
1 that
1 young
1 heart
1 she
1 could
1 not
1 have
1 spoken
1 in
1 a
1 tone
1 of
1 truer
1 pity
1 or
1 sincerer
1 goodwill
1 than
1 that
1 in
1 which
1 she
1 softly
1 said
1 Poor
1 girl
1 e
1 must
1 not
1 forget
1 her
1 for
1 with
1 all
1 her
1 wealth
1 she
1 is

1 compared
1 to

1 an
1 answering
1 spark
1 of
1 nobleness
1 in
1 her

1 Helen
1 s
1 face
1 changed
1 beautifully
1 as
1 she
1 tore
1 the
1 paper
1 to

1 in
1 a
1 glad
1 impetuous
1 tone
1 while
1 the
1 white
1 flakes
1 fluttered
1 from
1 her

1 I
1 too

1 you
1 are
1 I
1 ve

1 looking
1 for
1 you
1 everywhere
1 Don

1 you

1 s
1 the
1 House
1 against
1 the

1 boys
1 It
1 s
1 lucky
1 that
1 the

1 have
1 got
1 the
1 first
1 innings
1 they
1 began
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 ago
1 How
1 tiresome
1 Frank
1 Hargate
1 said
1 I
1 was
1 watching
1 a
1 most
1 interesting
1 thing
1 here
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 see
1 this
1 little
1 chaffinch
1 nest
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 with
1 a
1 newly
1 hatched
1 brood
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 small
1 black
1 snake
1 threatening
1 the
1 nest
1 and
1 the
1 mother
1 was
1 defending
1 it
1 with
1 quivering
1 wings
1 and
1 open
1 beak
1 I
1 never
1 saw
1 a
1 prettier
1 thing
1 I
1 sat
1 quite
1 still
1 and
1 neither
1 of
1 them
1 seemed
1 to
1 notice
1 me
1 Of
1 course
1 I
1 should
1 have
1 interfered
1 if
1 I
1 had
1 seen
1 the
1 snake
1 getting
1 the
1 best
1 of
1 it
1 hen
1 you
1 came
1 running
1 up
1 like
1 a
1 cart
1 horse
1 the
1 snake
1 glided
1 away
1 in
1 the
1 grass
1 and
1 the
1 bird
1 flew
1 off
1 Oh
1 dear
1 I
1 am
1 sorry
1 I
1 had
1 forgotten
1 all
1 about
1 the
1 match
1 I
1 never
1 saw
1 such
1 a
1 fellow
1 as
1 you
1 are
1 Hargate
1 Here
1 s
1 the
1 opening
1 match
1 of
1 the
1 season
1 and
1 you
1 who
1 are
1 one
1 of
1 our
1 best
1 bats
1 poking
1 about
1 after
1 birds
1 and
1 snakes
1 Come
1 along
1 Thompson
1 sent
1 me
1 and
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 other
1 fellows
1 off
1 in
1 all
1 directions
1 to
1 find

1 before

1 ilson
1 took
1 James
1 s
1 wicket
1 the
1 first
1 ball
1 Frank
1 Hargate
1 leaped
1 to
1 his
1 feet
1 and
1 laying
1 aside
1 for
1 the
1 present
1 all
1 thoughts
1 of
1 his
1 favorite
1 pursuit
1 started
1 off
1 at
1 a
1 run
1 to
1 the
1 playing
1 field
1 His
1 arrival
1 there
1 was
1 greeted
1 with
1 a
1 mingled
1 chorus
1 of
1 welcome
1 and
1 indignation
1 Frank
1 Hargate
1 was
1 next
1 to
1 Thompson
1 the
1 captain
1 of
1 the
1 Town
1 eleven
1 the
1 best
1 bat
1 among
1 the
1 home
1 boarders
1 He
1 played
1 a
1 steady
1 rather
1 than
1 a
1 brilliant
1 game
1 and
1 was
1 noted
1 as
1 a
1 good
1 sturdy
1 sticker
1 Had
1 he
1 been
1 there
1 Thompson
1 would
1 have
1 put
1 him
1 in
1 at
1 first
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 break
1 the
1 bowling
1 of
1 the
1 House
1 team
1 As
1 it
1 was
1 misfortunes
1 had
1 come
1 rapidly
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 Handcock
1 were
1 bowling
1 splendidly
1 and
1 none
1 of
1 the
1 Town
1 boys
1 were
1 making
1 any
1 stand
1 against
1 them
1 Thompson
1 himself
1 had
1 gone
1 in
1 when
1 the
1 fourth
1 wicket
1 fell
1 and
1 was
1 still
1 in
1 although
1 two
1 wickets
1 had
1 since
1 fallen
1 for
1 only
1 four
1 runs
1 and
1 the
1 seventh
1 wicket
1 fell
1 just
1 as
1 Frank
1 arrived
1 panting
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 Confound
1 you
1 Hargate
1 Thompson
1 shouted
1 where
1 have
1 you
1 been
1 And
1 not
1 even
1 in
1 flannels
1 yet
1 I
1 m
1 very
1 sorry
1 Frank
1 shouted
1 back
1 cheerfully
1 and
1 never
1 mind
1 the
1 flannels
1 for
1 once
1 Shall
1 I
1 come
1 in
1 now
1 No
1 Thompson
1 said
1 You
1 d
1 better
1 get
1 your
1 wind
1 first
1 Let
1 Fenner
1 come
1 in
1 next
1 Fenner
1 stayed
1 in
1 four
1 overs
1 adding
1 two
1 singles
1 as
1 his
1 share
1 while
1 Thompson
1 put
1 on
1 a
1 three
1 and
1 a
1 two
1 Then
1 Fenner
1 was
1 caught
1 Thirty
1 -one
1 runs
1 for
1 eight
1 wickets
1 Then
1 Frank
1 took
1 the
1 bat
1 and
1 walked
1 to
1 the
1 ground
1 Thompson
1 came
1 across
1 to
1 him
1 Look
1 here
1 Hargate
1 you
1 have
1 made
1 a
1 nice
1 mess
1 of
1 it
1 and
1 the
1 game
1 looks
1 as
1 bad
1 as
1 can
1 be
1 hatever
1 you
1 do
1 play
1 carefully
1 Don
1 t
1 let
1 out
1 at
1 anything
1 that
1 comes
1 straight
1 The
1 great
1 thing
1 is
1 to
1 bother
1 their
1 bowling
1 a
1 bit
1 They
1 re
1 so
1 cocky
1 now
1 that
1 pretty
1 near
1 every
1 ball
1 is
1 straight
1 on
1 the
1 wickets
1 Be
1 content
1 with
1 blocking
1 for
1 a
1 bit
1 and
1 Handcock
1 will
1 soon
1 go
1 off
1 He
1 always
1 gets
1 savage
1 if
1 his
1 bowling
1 is
1 collared
1 Frank
1 obeyed
1 orders
1 In
1 the
1 next
1 twenty
1 minutes
1 he
1 only
1 scored
1 six
1 runs
1 all
1 in
1 singles
1 while
1 Thompson
1 who
1 was
1 also
1 playing
1 very
1 carefully
1 put
1 on
1 thirteen
1 The
1 game
1 looked
1 more
1 hopeful
1 for
1 the
1 Town
1 boys
1 Then
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 shout
1 from
1 the
1 House
1 as
1 Thompson
1 s
1 middle
1 wicket
1 was
1 sent
1 flying
1 Childers
1 who
1 was
1 the
1 last
1 of
1 the
1 team
1 walked
1 out
1 Now
1 Childers
1 Thompson
1 said
1 don
1 t
1 you
1 hit
1 at
1 a
1 ball
1 You
1 re
1 safe
1 to
1 be
1 bowled
1 or
1 caught
1 if
1 you
1 do
1 Just
1 lift
1 your
1 bat
1 and
1 block
1 them
1 each
1 time
1 Now
1 Frank
1 it
1 s
1 your
1 turn
1 to
1 score
1 Put
1 them
1 on
1 as
1 fast
1 as
1 you
1 can
1 It
1 s
1 no
1 use
1 playing
1 carefully
1 any
1 longer
1 Frank
1 set
1 to
1 to
1 hit
1 in
1 earnest
1 He
1 had
1 now
1 got
1 his
1 eye
1 well
1 in
1 and
1 the
1 stand
1 which
1 he
1 and
1 Thompson
1 had
1 made
1 together
1 had
1 taken
1 the
1 sting
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 bowling
1 The
1 ball
1 which
1 had
1 taken
1 Thompson
1 s
1 wicket
1 was
1 the
1 last
1 of
1 the
1 over
1 Consequently
1 the
1 next
1 came
1 to
1 him
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 little
1 wide
1 and
1 Frank
1 stepping
1 out
1 drove
1 it
1 for
1 four
1 A
1 loud
1 shout
1 rose
1 from
1 the
1 Town
1 boys
1 There
1 had
1 only
1 been
1 one
1 four
1 scored
1 before
1 during
1 the
1 innings
1 Off
1 the
1 next
1 ball
1 Frank
1 scored
1 a
1 couple
1 blocked
1 the
1 next
1 and
1 drove
1 the
1 last
1 of
1 the
1 over
1 past
1 long
1 leg
1 for
1 four
1 The
1 next
1 over
1 Childers
1 strictly
1 obeyed
1 orders
1 blocking
1 each
1 ball
1 Then
1 it
1 was
1 Frank
1 s
1 turn
1 again
1 and
1 seven
1 more
1 went
1 up
1 on
1 the
1 board
1 They
1 remained
1 together
1 for
1 just
1 fifteen
1 minutes
1 but
1 during
1 that
1 time
1 thirty
1 -one
1 had
1 been
1 added
1 to
1 the
1 score
1 Frank
1 was
1 caught
1 at
1 cover
1 point
1 having
1 added
1 twenty
1 -eight
1 since
1 Thompson
1 left
1 him
1 the
1 other
1 three
1 being
1 credited
1 to
1 Childers
1 The
1 total
1 was
1 eighty
1 -one
1 -
1 -not
1 a
1 bad
1 score
1 in
1 a
1 school
1 match
1 ell
1 you
1 ve
1 redeemed
1 yourself
1 Thompson
1 said
1 as
1 Frank
1 walked
1 to
1 the
1 tent
1 You
1 played
1 splendidly
1 old
1 fellow
1 when
1 you
1 did
1 come
1 If
1 we
1 do
1 as
1 well
1 next
1 innings
1 we
1 are
1 safe
1 They
1 re
1 not
1 likely
1 to
1 average
1 eighty
1 Now
1 get
1 on
1 your
1 wicket
1 -keeping
1 gloves
1 Green
1 and
1 I
1 will
1 bowl
1 The
1 House
1 scored
1 rapidly
1 at
1 first
1 and
1 fifty
1 runs
1 were
1 put
1 on
1 with
1 the
1 loss
1 of
1 four
1 wickets
1 Then
1 misfortune
1 fell
1 upon
1 them
1 and
1 the
1 remaining
1 six
1 fell
1 for
1 nineteen
1 The
1 next
1 innings
1 Frank
1 went
1 in
1 first
1 but
1 was
1 caught
1 when
1 the
1 score
1 stood
1 at
1 fifteen
1 Thompson
1 made
1 fourteen
1 but
1 the
1 rest
1 scored
1 but
1 badly
1 and
1 the
1 whole
1 were
1 out
1 for
1 forty
1 -eight
1 The
1 House
1 had
1 sixty
1 -one
1 to
1 get
1 to
1 win
1 Six
1 wickets
1 had
1 fallen
1 for
1 fifty
1 -one
1 runs
1 when
1 Thompson
1 put
1 Childers
1 on
1 to
1 bowl
1 The
1 change
1 was
1 a
1 fortunate
1 one
1 Ruthven
1 s
1 stumps
1 were
1 lowered
1 at
1 the
1 first
1 ball
1 Handcock
1 was
1 caught
1 off
1 the
1 second
1 The
1 spirits
1 of
1 the
1 Town
1 boys
1 rose
1 There
1 were
1 but
1 two
1 wickets
1 more
1 and
1 still
1 ten
1 runs
1 to
1 get
1 to
1 win
1 The
1 House
1 played
1 cautiously
1 now
1 and
1 overs
1 were
1 sent
1 down
1 without
1 a
1 run
1 Then
1 off
1 a
1 ball
1 from
1 Childers
1 a
1 four
1 was
1 scored
1 but
1 the
1 next
1 ball
1 leveled
1 the
1 outside
1 stump
1 Then
1 by
1 singles
1 the
1 score
1 mounted
1 up
1 until
1 a
1 tremendous
1 shout
1 from
1 the
1 House
1 announced
1 that
1 the

1 I
1 never

1 making
1 up
1 my

1 that
1 I

1 But
1 somehow
1 there
1 is

1 If

1 my

1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 you
1 have
1 washed
1 your

1 we
1 will
1 have
1 tea
1 It
1 was
1 a

1 meal
1 thick
1 slices
1 of
1 bread
1 and

1 and

1 for

1 could

1 and
1 even
1 for

1 well
1 laden
1 Frank
1 fortunately
1 cared
1 very
1 little
1 what
1 he
1 ate
1 and
1 what
1 was
1 good
1 enough
1 for
1 his
1 mother
1 was
1 good
1 enough
1 for
1 him
1 In
1 his
1 father
1 s
1 lifetime
1 things
1 had
1 been
1 different
1 but
1 Captain
1 Hargate
1 had
1 fallen
1 in
1 battle
1 in
1 New
1 Zealand
1 He
1 had
1 nothing
1 besides
1 his
1 pay
1 and
1 his
1 wife
1 and
1 children
1 had
1 lived
1 with
1 him
1 in
1 barracks
1 until
1 his
1 regiment
1 was
1 ordered
1 out
1 to
1 New
1 Zealand
1 when
1 he
1 had
1 placed
1 his
1 wife
1 in
1 the
1 little
1 cottage
1 she
1 now
1 occupied
1 He
1 had
1 fallen
1 in
1 an
1 attack
1 on
1 a
1 Maori
1 pah
1 a
1 fortnight
1 after
1 landing
1 in
1 New
1 Zealand
1 He
1 had
1 always
1 intended
1 Frank
1 to
1 enter
1 the
1 military
1 profession
1 and
1 had
1 himself
1 directed
1 his
1 education
1 so
1 long
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 at
1 home
1 The
1 loss
1 of
1 his
1 father
1 had
1 been
1 a
1 terrible
1 blow
1 for
1 the
1 boy
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 his
1 constant
1 companion
1 when
1 off
1 duty
1 Captain
1 Hargate
1 had
1 been
1 devoted
1 to
1 field
1 sports
1 and
1 was
1 an
1 excellent
1 naturalist
1 The
1 latter
1 taste
1 Frank
1 had
1 inherited
1 from
1 him
1 His
1 father
1 had
1 brought
1 home
1 from
1 India
1 -
1 -where
1 the
1 regiment
1 had
1 been
1 stationed
1 until
1 it
1 returned
1 for
1 its
1 turn
1 of
1 home
1 service
1 four
1 years
1 before
1 he
1 left
1 New
1 Zealand
1 -
1 -a
1 very
1 large
1 quantity
1 of
1 skins
1 of
1 birds
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 shot
1 there
1 These
1 he
1 had
1 stuffed
1 and
1 mounted
1 and
1 so
1 dexterous
1 was
1 he
1 at
1 the
1 work
1 so
1 natural
1 and
1 artistic
1 were
1 the
1 groups
1 of
1 birds
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 enabled
1 to
1 add
1 considerably
1 to
1 his
1 income
1 by
1 sending
1 these
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 shop
1 of
1 a
1 London
1 naturalist
1 He
1 had
1 instructed
1 Frank
1 in
1 his
1 methods
1 and
1 had
1 given
1 him
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 long
1 blowguns
1 used
1 by
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 hill
1 tribes
1 in
1 India
1 The
1 boy
1 had
1 attained
1 such
1 dexterity
1 in
1 its
1 use
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 able
1 with
1 his
1 clay
1 pellets
1 to
1 bring
1 down
1 sitting
1 birds
1 however
1 small
1 with
1 almost
1 unerring
1 accuracy
1 These
1 he
1 stuffed
1 and
1 mounted
1 arranging
1 them
1 with
1 a
1 taste
1 and
1 skill
1 which
1 delighted
1 the
1 few
1 visitors
1 at
1 his
1 mother
1 s
1 cottage
1 Frank
1 was
1 ready
1 to
1 join
1 in
1 a
1 game
1 of
1 football
1 or
1 cricket
1 when
1 wanted
1 and
1 could
1 hold
1 his
1 own
1 in
1 either
1 But
1 he
1 vastly
1 preferred
1 to
1 go
1 out
1 for
1 long
1 walks
1 with
1 his
1 blowgun
1 his
1 net
1 and
1 his
1 collecting
1 boxes
1 At
1 home
1 every
1 moment
1 not
1 required
1 for
1 the
1 preparation
1 of
1 his
1 lessons
1 was
1 spent
1 in
1 mounting
1 and
1 arranging
1 his
1 captures
1 He
1 was
1 quite
1 ready
1 to
1 follow
1 the
1 course
1 his
1 father
1 proposed
1 for
1 him
1 and
1 to
1 enter
1 the
1 army
1 Captain
1 Hargate
1 had
1 been
1 a
1 very
1 gallant
1 officer
1 and
1 the
1 despatches
1 had
1 spoken
1 most
1 highly
1 of
1 the
1 bravery
1 with
1 which
1 he
1 led
1 his
1 company
1 into
1 action
1 in
1 the
1 fight
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 lost
1 his
1 life
1 Therefore
1 Mrs
1 Hargate
1 hoped
1 that
1 Frank
1 would
1 have
1 little
1 difficulty
1 in
1 obtaining
1 a
1 commission
1 without
1 purchase
1 when
1 the
1 time
1 for
1 his
1 entering
1 the
1 army
1 arrived
1 Frank
1 s
1 desire
1 for
1 a
1 military
1 life
1 was
1 based
1 chiefly
1 upon
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 it
1 would
1 enable
1 him
1 to
1 travel
1 to
1 many
1 parts
1 of
1 the
1 world
1 and
1 to
1 indulge
1 his
1 taste
1 for
1 natural
1 history
1 to
1 the
1 fullest
1 He
1 was
1 but
1 ten
1 years
1 old
1 when
1 he
1 left
1 India
1 with
1 the
1 regiment
1 but
1 he
1 had
1 still
1 a
1 vivid
1 recollection
1 of
1 the
1 lovely
1 butterflies
1 and
1 bright
1 birds
1 of
1 that
1 country
1 His
1 father
1 had
1 been
1 at
1 pains
1 to
1 teach
1 him
1 that
1 a
1 student
1 of
1 natural
1 history
1 must
1 be
1 more
1 than
1 a
1 mere
1 collector
1 and
1 that
1 like
1 other
1 sciences
1 it
1 must
1 be
1 methodically
1 studied
1 He
1 possessed
1 an
1 excellent
1 library
1 of
1 books
1 upon
1 the
1 subject
1 and
1 although
1 Frank
1 might
1 be
1 ignorant
1 of
1 the
1 name
1 of
1 any
1 bird
1 or
1 insect
1 shown
1 to
1 him
1 he
1 could
1 at
1 once
1 name
1 the
1 family
1 and
1 species
1 In
1 the
1 year
1 which
1 Frank
1 had
1 been
1 at
1 school
1 at
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 s
1 he
1 had
1 made
1 few
1 intimate
1 friends
1 His
1 habits
1 of
1 solitary
1 wandering
1 and
1 studious
1 indoor
1 work
1 had
1 hindered
1 his
1 becoming
1 the
1 chum
1 of
1 any
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 and
1 this
1 absence
1 of
1 intimacy
1 had
1 been
1 increased
1 by
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 the
1 straitness
1 of
1 his
1 mother
1 s
1 means
1 prevented
1 his
1 inviting
1 any
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 to
1 his
1 home
1 He
1 had
1 indeed
1 brought
1 one
1 or
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 boys
1 whose
1 tastes
1 lay
1 in
1 the
1 direction
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 to
1 the
1 house
1 to
1 show
1 them
1 his
1 collections
1 of
1 birds
1 and
1 insects
1 But
1 he
1 declined
1 their
1 invitations
1 to
1 visit
1 them
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 unable
1 to
1 return
1 their
1 hospitality
1 and
1 was
1 too
1 proud
1 to
1 eat
1 and
1 drink
1 at
1 other
1 fellows
1 houses
1 when
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 ask
1 them
1 to
1 do
1 the
1 same
1 at
1 his
1 own
1 It
1 was
1 understood
1 at
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 s
1 that
1 Frank
1 Hargate
1 s
1 people
1 were
1 poor
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 known
1 that
1 his
1 father
1 had
1 been
1 killed
1 in
1 battle
1 There
1 are
1 writers
1 who
1 depict
1 boys
1 as
1 worshipers
1 of
1 wealth
1 and
1 many
1 pictures
1 have
1 been
1 drawn
1 of
1 the
1 slights
1 and
1 indignities
1 to
1 which
1 boys
1 whose
1 means
1 are
1 inferior
1 to
1 those
1 of
1 their
1 schoolfellows
1 are
1 subject
1 I
1 am
1 happy
1 to
1 believe
1 that
1 this
1 is
1 a
1 libel
1 There
1 are
1 it
1 is
1 true
1 toadies
1 and
1 tuft
1 hunters
1 among
1 boys
1 as
1 among
1 men
1 That
1 odious
1 creature
1 the
1 parasite
1 of
1 the
1 Greek
1 and
1 Latin
1 plays
1 exists
1 still
1 but
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 believe
1 that
1 a
1 boy
1 is
1 one
1 whit
1 the
1 less
1 liked
1 or
1 is
1 ever
1 taunted
1 with
1 his
1 poverty
1 provided
1 he
1 is
1 a
1 good
1 fellow
1 Most
1 of
1 the
1 miseries
1 endured
1 by
1 boys
1 whose
1 pocket
1 money
1 is
1 less
1 abundant
1 than
1 that
1 of
1 their
1 fellows
1 are
1 purely
1 self
1 inflicted
1 Boys
1 and
1 men
1 who
1 are
1 always
1 on
1 the
1 lookout
1 for
1 slights
1 will
1 of
1 course
1 find
1 what
1 they
1 seek
1 But
1 the
1 lad
1 who
1 is
1 not
1 ashamed
1 of
1 what
1 is
1 no
1 fault
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 who
1 frankly
1 and
1 manfully
1 says
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 afford
1 it
1 will
1 not
1 find
1 that
1 he
1 is
1 in
1 any
1 way
1 looked
1 down
1 upon
1 by
1 those
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 whose
1 good
1 opinion
1 is
1 in
1 the
1 smallest
1 degree
1 worth
1 having
1 Certainly
1 this
1 was
1 so
1 in
1 the
1 case
1 of
1 Frank
1 Hargate
1 He
1 was
1 never
1 in
1 the
1 slightest
1 degree
1 ashamed
1 of
1 saying
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 afford
1 it
1 and
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 the
1 son
1 of
1 an
1 officer
1 killed
1 in
1 battle
1 gave
1 him
1 a
1 standing
1 among
1 the
1 best
1 in
1 the
1 school
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 his
1 want
1 of
1 pocket
1 money
1 Frank
1 was
1 friends
1 with
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 fishermen
1 and
1 these
1 would
1 often
1 bring
1 him
1 strange
1 fish
1 and
1 sea
1 creatures
1 brought
1 up
1 in
1 their
1 nets
1 instead
1 of
1 throwing
1 them
1 back
1 into
1 the
1 sea
1 During
1 the
1 holidays
1 he
1 would
1 sometimes
1 go
1 out
1 with
1 them
1 for
1 twenty
1 -four
1 hours
1 in
1 their
1 fishing
1 -boats
1 His
1 mother
1 made
1 no
1 objection
1 to
1 this
1 as
1 she
1 thought
1 that
1 the
1 exercise
1 and
1 sea
1 air
1 were
1 good
1 for
1 his
1 health
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 change
1 did
1 him
1 good
1 Frank
1 himself
1 was
1 so
1 fond
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 half
1 disposed
1 to
1 adopt
1 it
1 instead
1 of
1 the
1 army
1 as
1 a
1 profession
1 But
1 his
1 mother
1 was
1 strongly
1 opposed
1 to
1 the
1 idea
1 and
1 won
1 him
1 to
1 her
1 way
1 of
1 thinking
1 by
1 pointing
1 out
1 that
1 although
1 a
1 sailor
1 visits
1 many
1 ports
1 he
1 stays
1 long
1 at
1 none
1 of
1 them
1 and
1 that
1 in
1 the
1 few
1 hours
1 leave
1 he
1 might
1 occasionally
1 obtain
1 he
1 would
1 be
1 unable

1 carry

1 we
1 shall
1 have
1 a
1 long
1 afternoon
1 of
1 it
1 ill
1 you
1 come
1 with
1 us
1 Thank
1 you
1 Ruthven
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 it
1 very
1 much
1 but
1 you
1 know
1 I
1 m
1 short
1 of
1 pocket
1 money
1 and
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 pay
1 my
1 share
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 so
1 I
1 would
1 rather
1 leave
1 it
1 alone
1 Oh
1 nonsense
1 Hargate
1 Ruthven
1 answered
1 we
1 know
1 money
1 is
1 not
1 your
1 strong
1 point
1 but
1 we
1 really
1 want
1 you
1 to
1 go
1 with
1 us
1 You
1 can
1 manage
1 a
1 boat
1 better
1 than
1 any
1 of
1 us
1 and
1 you
1 will
1 really
1 oblige
1 us
1 if
1 you
1 will
1 go
1 with
1 us
1 Oh
1 if
1 you
1 put
1 it
1 in
1 that
1 way
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 glad
1 to
1 go
1 with
1 you
1 but
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 think
1 he
1 went
1 on
1 looking
1 at
1 the
1 sky
1 that
1 the
1 weather
1 looks
1 very
1 settled
1 However
1 if
1 you
1 do
1 not
1 mind
1 the
1 chance
1 of
1 a
1 ducking
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 That
1 s
1 agreed
1 then
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 will
1 you
1 meet
1 us
1 near
1 the
1 pier
1 at
1 three
1 o
1 clock
1 All
1 right
1 I
1 ll
1 be
1 punctual
1 At
1 the
1 appointed
1 hour
1 the
1 four
1 lads
1 met
1 on
1 the
1 beach
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 his
1 companions
1 wanted
1 to
1 choose
1 a
1 light
1 rowing
1 boat
1 but
1 Frank
1 strongly
1 urged
1 them
1 to
1 take
1 a
1 much
1 larger
1 and
1 heavier
1 one
1 In
1 the
1 first
1 place
1 he
1 said
1 the
1 wind
1 is
1 blowing
1 off
1 shore
1 and
1 although
1 it
1 s
1 calm
1 here
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 rougher
1 farther
1 out
1 and
1 unless
1 I
1 m
1 mistaken
1 the
1 wind
1 is
1 getting
1 up
1 fast
1 Besides
1 this
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 much
1 more
1 comfortable
1 to
1 fish
1 from
1 a
1 good
1 sized
1 boat
1 His
1 comrades
1 grumbled
1 at
1 the
1 extra
1 labor
1 which
1 the
1 large
1 boat
1 would
1 entail
1 in
1 rowing
1 However
1 they
1 finally
1 gave
1 in
1 and
1 the
1 boat
1 was
1 launched
1 Look
1 out
1 Master
1 Hargate
1 the
1 boatman
1 said
1 as
1 they
1 started
1 you
1 d
1 best
1 not
1 go
1 out
1 too
1 far
1 for
1 the
1 wind
1 is
1 freshening
1 fast
1 and
1 we
1 shall
1 have
1 I
1 think
1 a
1 nasty
1 night
1 The
1 boys
1 thought
1 little
1 of
1 the
1 warning
1 for
1 the
1 sky
1 was
1 bright
1 and
1 blue
1 broken
1 only
1 by
1 a
1 few
1 gauzy
1 white
1 clouds
1 which
1 streaked
1 it
1 here
1 and
1 there
1 They
1 rowed
1 out
1 about
1 a
1 mile
1 and
1 then
1 laying
1 in
1 their
1 oars
1 lowered
1 their
1 grapnel
1 and
1 began
1 to
1 fish
1 The
1 sport
1 was
1 good
1 The
1 fish
1 bit
1 freely
1 and
1 were
1 rapidly
1 hauled
1 on
1 board
1 Even
1 Frank
1 was
1 so
1 absorbed
1 in
1 the
1 pursuit
1 that
1 he
1 paid
1 no
1 attention
1 to
1 the
1 changing
1 aspect
1 of
1 the
1 sky
1 the
1 increasing
1 roughness
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 or
1 the
1 rapidly
1 rising
1 wind
1 Suddenly
1 a
1 heavy
1 drop
1 or
1 two
1 of
1 rain
1 fell
1 in
1 the
1 boat
1 All
1 looked
1 up
1 e
1 are
1 in
1 for
1 a
1 squall
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 and
1 no
1 mistake
1 I
1 told
1 you
1 you
1 would
1 get
1 a
1 ducking
1 Ruthven
1 He
1 had
1 scarcely
1 spoken
1 when
1 the
1 squall
1 was
1 upon
1 them
1 A
1 deluge
1 of
1 rain
1 swept
1 down
1 driven
1 by
1 a
1 strong
1 squall
1 of
1 wind
1 Sit
1 in
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 Frank
1 said
1 this
1 is
1 a
1 snorter
1 Not
1 a
1 word
1 was
1 said
1 for
1 ten
1 minutes
1 long
1 before
1 which
1 all
1 were
1 drenched
1 to
1 the
1 skin
1 ith
1 the
1 rain
1 a
1 sudden
1 darkness
1 had
1 fallen
1 and
1 the
1 land
1 was
1 entirely
1 invisible
1 Frank
1 looked
1 anxiously
1 towards
1 the
1 shore
1 The
1 sea
1 was
1 getting
1 up
1 fast
1 and
1 the
1 boat
1 tugging
1 and
1 straining
1 at
1 the
1 cord
1 of
1 the
1 grapnel
1 He
1 shook
1 his
1 head
1 It
1 looks
1 very
1 bad
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 himself
1 If
1 this
1 squall
1 does
1 not
1 abate
1 we
1 are
1 going
1 to
1 have
1 a
1 bad
1 time
1 of
1 it
1 A
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 after
1 it
1 commenced
1 the
1 heavy
1 downpour
1 of
1 rain
1 ceased
1 or
1 rather
1 changed
1 into
1 a
1 driving
1 sleet
1 It
1 was
1 still
1 extremely
1 dark
1 a
1 thick
1 lead
1 colored
1 cloud
1 overspread
1 the
1 sky
1 Already
1 the
1 white
1 horses
1 showed
1 how
1 fast
1 the
1 sea
1 was
1 rising
1 and
1 the
1 wind
1 showed
1 no
1 signs
1 of
1 falling
1 with
1 the
1 cessation
1 of
1 the
1 rain
1 storm
1 The
1 boat
1 was
1 laboring
1 at
1 her
1 head
1 rope
1 and
1 dipping
1 her
1 nose
1 heavily
1 into
1 the
1 waves
1 Look
1 here
1 you
1 fellows
1 Frank
1 shouted
1 we
1 must
1 take
1 to
1 the
1 oars
1 If
1 the
1 rope
1 were
1 a
1 long
1 one
1 we
1 might
1 ride
1 here
1 but
1 you
1 know
1 it
1 little
1 more
1 than
1 reached
1 the
1 ground
1 when
1 we
1 threw
1 it
1 out
1 I
1 believe
1 she
1 s
1 dragging
1 already
1 and
1 even
1 if
1 she
1 isn
1 t
1 she
1 would
1 pull
1 her
1 head
1 under
1 water
1 with
1 so
1 short
1 a
1 rope
1 when
1 the
1 sea
1 gets
1 up
1 e
1 d
1 better
1 get
1 out
1 the
1 oars
1 and
1 row
1 to
1 shore
1 if
1 we
1 can
1 before
1 the
1 sea
1 gets
1 worse
1 The
1 lads
1 got
1 up
1 and
1 looked
1 round
1 and
1 their
1 faces
1 grew
1 pale
1 and
1 somewhat
1 anxious
1 as
1 they
1 saw
1 how
1 threatening
1 was
1 the
1 aspect
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 They
1 had
1 four
1 oars
1 on
1 board
1 and
1 these
1 were
1 soon
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 and
1 the
1 grapnel
1 hauled
1 up
1 A
1 few
1 strokes
1 sufficed
1 to
1 show
1 them
1 that
1 with
1 all
1 four
1 rowing
1 the
1 boat
1 s
1 head
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 kept
1 towards
1 the
1 shore
1 the
1 wind
1 taking
1 it
1 and
1 turning
1 the
1 boat
1 broadside
1 on
1 This
1 will
1 never
1 do
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 will
1 steer
1 and
1 you
1 row
1 two
1 oars
1 on
1 one
1 side
1 and
1 one
1 on
1 the
1 other
1 I
1 will
1 take
1 a
1 spell
1 presently
1 Row
1 steadily
1 Ruthven
1 he
1 shouted
1 don
1 t
1 spurt
1 e
1 have
1 a
1 long
1 row
1 before
1 us
1 and
1 must
1 not
1 knock
1 ourselves
1 up
1 at
1 the
1 beginning
1 For
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 not
1 a
1 word
1 was
1 spoken
1 beyond
1 an
1 occasional
1 cheery
1 exhortation
1 from
1 Frank
1 The
1 shore
1 could
1 be
1 dimly
1 seen
1 at
1 times
1 through
1 the
1 driving
1 mist
1 and
1 Frank
1 s
1 heart
1 sank
1 as
1 he
1 recognized
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 further
1 off
1 than
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 when
1 they
1 first
1 began
1 to
1 row
1 The
1 wind
1 was
1 blowing
1 a
1 gale
1 now
1 and
1 although
1 but
1 two
1 miles
1 from
1 shore
1 the
1 sea
1 was
1 already
1 rough
1 for
1 an
1 open
1 boat
1 Here
1 Ruthven
1 you
1 take
1 a
1 spell
1 now
1 he
1 said
1 Although
1 the
1 rowers
1 had
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 glanced
1 over
1 their
1 shoulders
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 through
1 the
1 mist
1 form
1 any
1 idea
1 of
1 their
1 position
1 hen
1 Ruthven
1 took
1 the
1 helm
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 Good
1 gracious
1 Frank
1 the
1 shore
1 is
1 hardly
1 visible
1 e
1 are
1 being
1 blown
1 out
1 to
1 sea
1 I
1 am
1 afraid
1 we
1 are
1 Frank
1 said
1 but
1 there
1 is
1 nothing
1 to
1 do
1 but
1 to
1 keep
1 on
1 rowing
1 The
1 wind
1 may
1 lull
1 or
1 it
1 may
1 shift
1 and
1 give
1 us
1 a
1 chance
1 of
1 making
1 for
1 Ramsgate
1 The
1 boat
1 is
1 a
1 good
1 sea
1 boat
1 and
1 may
1 keep
1 afloat
1 even
1 if
1 we
1 are
1 driven
1 out
1 to
1 sea
1 Or
1 if
1 we
1 are
1 missed
1 from
1 shore
1 they
1 may
1 send
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 out
1 after
1 us
1 That
1 is
1 our
1 best
1 chance
1 In
1 another
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 Ruthven
1 was
1 ready
1 to
1 take
1 another
1 spell
1 at
1 the
1 oar
1 I
1 fear
1 Frank
1 shouted
1 to
1 him
1 as
1 he
1 climbed
1 over
1 the
1 seat
1 there
1 is
1 no
1 chance
1 whatever
1 of
1 making
1 shore
1 All
1 we
1 ve
1 got
1 to
1 do
1 is
1 to
1 row
1 steadily
1 and
1 keep
1 her
1 head
1 dead
1 to
1 wind
1 Two
1 of
1 us
1 will
1 do
1 for
1 that
1 You
1 and
1 I
1 will
1 row
1 now
1 and
1 let
1 Handcock
1 and
1 Jones
1 steer
1 and
1 rest
1 by
1 turns
1 Then
1 when
1 we
1 are
1 done
1 up
1 they
1 can
1 take
1 our
1 places
1 In
1 another
1 hour
1 it
1 was
1 quite
1 dark
1 save
1 for
1 the
1 gray
1 light
1 from
1 the
1 foaming
1 water
1 around
1 The
1 wind
1 was
1 blowing
1 stronger
1 than
1 ever
1 and
1 it
1 required
1 the
1 greatest
1 care
1 on
1 the
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 steersman
1 to
1 keep
1 her
1 dead
1 in
1 the
1 eye
1 of
1 the
1 wind
1 Handcock
1 was
1 steering
1 now
1 and
1 Jones
1 lying
1 at
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 where
1 he
1 was
1 sheltered
1 at
1 least
1 from
1 the
1 wind
1 All
1 the
1 lads
1 were
1 plucky
1 fellows
1 and
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 semblance
1 of
1 good
1 spirits
1 but
1 all
1 in
1 their
1 hearts
1 knew
1 that
1 their
1 position
1 was
1 a

1 one
1 CHAPTER
1 II
1 A
1 MAD
1 DOG
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 think
1 Hargate
1 Ruthven
1 shouted
1 in
1 his
1 ear
1 we
1 had
1 better
1 run
1 before
1 it
1 It
1 s
1 as
1 much
1 as
1 Handcock
1 can
1 do
1 to
1 keep
1 her
1 head
1 straight
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 shouted
1 back
1 if
1 it
1 were
1 not
1 for
1 the
1 Goodwins
1 They
1 lie
1 right
1 across
1 ahead
1 of
1 us
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 no
1 more
1 and
1 for
1 another
1 hour
1 he
1 and
1 Frank
1 rowed
1 their
1 hardest
1 Then
1 Handcock
1 and
1 Jones
1 took
1 the
1 oars
1 Ruthven
1 lay
1 down
1 in
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 and
1 Frank
1 steered
1 After
1 rowing
1 for
1 another
1 hour
1 Frank
1 found
1 that
1 he
1 could
1 no
1 longer
1 keep
1 the
1 boat
1 head
1 to
1 wind
1 Indeed
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 have
1 done
1 so
1 for
1 so
1 long
1 had
1 he
1 not
1 shipped
1 the
1 rudder
1 and
1 steered
1 the
1 boat
1 with
1 an
1 oar
1 through
1 a
1 notch
1 cut
1 in
1 the
1 stern
1 for
1 the
1 purpose
1 Already
1 the
1 boat
1 shipped
1 several
1 heavy
1 seas
1 and
1 Ruthven
1 was
1 kept
1 hard
1 at
1 work
1 baling
1 with
1 a
1 tin
1 can
1 in
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 brought
1 out
1 bait
1 Ruthven
1 we
1 must
1 let
1 her
1 run
1 Put
1 out
1 the
1 other
1 oar
1 we
1 must
1 watch
1 our
1 time
1 Row
1 hard
1 when
1 I
1 give
1 the
1 word
1 The
1 maneuver
1 was
1 safely
1 accomplished
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 minute
1 the
1 boat
1 was
1 flying
1 before
1 the
1 gale
1 Keep
1 on
1 rowing
1 Frank
1 said
1 but
1 take
1 it
1 easily
1 e
1 must
1 try
1 and
1 make
1 for
1 the
1 tail
1 of
1 the
1 sands
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 the
1 lightship
1 Frank
1 soon
1 found
1 that
1 the
1 wind
1 was
1 blowing
1 too
1 directly
1 upon
1 the
1 long
1 line
1 of
1 sands
1 to
1 enable
1 him
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 lightship
1 Already
1 far
1 ahead
1 a
1 gray
1 light
1 seemed
1 to
1 gleam
1 up
1 marking
1 where
1 the
1 sea
1 was
1 breaking
1 over
1 the
1 dreaded
1 shoal
1 I
1 am
1 afraid
1 it
1 is
1 no
1 use
1 he
1 said
1 Now
1 boys
1 we
1 had
1 best
1 each
1 of
1 us
1 say
1 our
1 prayers
1 to
1 God
1 and
1 prepare
1 to
1 die
1 bravely
1 for
1 I
1 fear
1 that
1 there
1 is
1 no
1 hope
1 for
1 us
1 There
1 was
1 silence
1 in
1 the
1 boat
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 five
1 minutes
1 as
1 the
1 boys
1 sat
1 with
1 their
1 heads
1 bent
1 down
1 More
1 than
1 one
1 choking
1 sob
1 might
1 have
1 been
1 heard
1 had
1 the
1 wind
1 lulled
1 as
1 they
1 thought
1 of
1 the
1 dear
1 ones
1 at
1 home
1 Suddenly
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 flash
1 of
1 light
1 ahead
1 and
1 the
1 boom
1 of
1 a
1 gun
1 directly
1 afterwards
1 came
1 upon
1 their
1 ears
1 Then
1 a
1 rocket
1 soared
1 up
1 into
1 the
1 air
1 There
1 is
1 a
1 vessel
1 on
1 the
1 sands
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 Let
1 us
1 make
1 for
1 her
1 If
1 we
1 can
1 get
1 on
1 board
1 we
1 shall
1 have
1 a
1 better
1 chance
1 than
1 here
1 The
1 boys
1 again
1 bent
1 to
1 their
1 oars
1 and
1 Frank
1 tried
1 to
1 steer
1 exactly
1 for
1 the
1 spot
1 whence
1 the
1 rocket
1 had
1 gone
1 up
1 Presently
1 another
1 gun
1 flashed
1 out
1 There
1 she
1 is
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 her
1 now
1 against
1 the
1 line
1 of
1 breakers
1 Take
1 the
1 oar
1 again
1 Ruthven
1 e
1 must
1 bring
1 up
1 under
1 shelter
1 of
1 her
1 lee
1 In
1 another
1 minute
1 or
1 two
1 they
1 were
1 within
1 a
1 hundred
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 ship
1 She
1 was
1 a
1 large
1 vessel
1 and
1 lay
1 just
1 at
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 broken
1 water
1 The
1 waves
1 as
1 they
1 struck
1 her
1 flew
1 high
1 above
1 her
1 deck
1 As
1 the
1 boat
1 neared
1 her
1 a
1 bright
1 light
1 suddenly
1 sprang
1 up
1 The
1 ship
1 was
1 burning
1 a
1 blue
1 light
1 Then
1 a
1 faint
1 cheer
1 was
1 heard
1 They
1 see
1 us
1 Frank
1 said
1 They
1 must
1 think
1 we
1 are
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 hat
1 a
1 disappointment
1 for
1 them
1 Now
1 steady
1 lads
1 and
1 prepare
1 to
1 pull
1 her
1 round
1 the
1 instant
1 we
1 are
1 under
1 her
1 stern
1 I
1 will
1 go
1 as
1 near
1 as
1 I
1 dare
1 Frank
1 could
1 see
1 the
1 people
1 on
1 deck
1 watching
1 the
1 boat
1 They
1 must
1 have
1 seen
1 now
1 that
1 she
1 was
1 not
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 but
1 even
1 in
1 their
1 own
1 danger
1 they
1 must
1 have
1 watched
1 with
1 intense
1 interest
1 the
1 efforts
1 of
1 the
1 tiny
1 boat
1 adrift
1 in
1 the
1 raging
1 sea
1 to
1 reach
1 them
1 Frank
1 steered
1 the
1 boat
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 stern
1 Then
1 Jones
1 and
1 Ruthven
1 who
1 were
1 both
1 rowing
1 the
1 same
1 side
1 exerted
1 themselves
1 to
1 the
1 utmost
1 while
1 Frank
1 pushed
1 with
1 the
1 steering
1 oar
1 A
1 minute
1 later
1 and
1 they
1 lay
1 in
1 comparatively
1 still
1 water
1 under
1 the
1 lee
1 of
1 the
1 ship
1 Two
1 or
1 three
1 ropes
1 were
1 thrown
1 them
1 and
1 they
1 speedily
1 climbed
1 on
1 board
1 e
1 thought
1 you
1 were
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 at
1 first
1 the
1 captain
1 said
1 as
1 they
1 reached
1 the
1 deck
1 but
1 of
1 course
1 they
1 cannot
1 be
1 here
1 for
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 hours
1 yet
1 e
1 were
1 blown
1 off
1 shore
1 sir
1 Frank
1 said
1 and
1 have
1 been
1 rowing
1 against
1 the
1 wind
1 for
1 hours
1 ell
1 my
1 lads
1 the
1 captain
1 said
1 you
1 have
1 only
1 prolonged
1 your
1 lives
1 for
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 for
1 she
1 will
1 not
1 hold
1 together
1 long
1 The
1 ship
1 indeed
1 presented
1 a
1 pitiable
1 appearance
1 The
1 masts
1 had
1 already
1 gone
1 the
1 bulwark
1 to
1 windward
1 had
1 been
1 carried
1 away
1 and
1 the
1 hull
1 lay
1 heeled
1 over
1 at
1 a
1 sharp
1 angle
1 her
1 deck
1 to
1 leeward
1 being
1 level
1 with
1 the
1 water
1 The
1 crew
1 were
1 huddled
1 down
1 near
1 the
1 lee
1 bulwarks
1 sheltered
1 somewhat
1 by
1 the
1 sharp
1 slope
1 of
1 the
1 deck
1 from
1 the
1 force
1 of
1 the
1 wind
1 As
1 each
1 wave
1 broke
1 over
1 the
1 ship
1 tons
1 of
1 water
1 rushed
1 down
1 upon
1 them
1 No
1 more
1 guns
1 were
1 fired
1 for
1 the
1 lashing
1 had
1 broken
1 and
1 the
1 gun
1 run
1 down
1 to
1 leeward
1 Already
1 there
1 were
1 signs
1 that
1 the
1 ship
1 would
1 break
1 up
1 ere
1 long
1 and
1 no
1 hope
1 existed
1 that
1 rescue
1 could
1 arrive
1 in
1 time
1 Suddenly
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 great
1 crash
1 and
1 the
1 vessel
1 parted
1 amidships
1 A
1 few
1 minutes
1 will
1 settle
1 it
1 now
1 the
1 captain
1 said
1 God
1 help
1 us
1 all
1 At
1 this
1 moment
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 shout
1 to
1 leeward
1 which
1 was
1 answered
1 by
1 a
1 scream
1 of
1 joy
1 from
1 those
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 wreck
1 for
1 there
1 close
1 alongside
1 lay
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 whose
1 approach
1 had
1 been
1 entirely
1 unseen
1 In
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 the
1 fifteen
1 men
1 who
1 remained
1 of
1 the
1 twenty
1 -two
1 who
1 had
1 formed
1 the
1 crew
1 of
1 the
1 wreck
1 and
1 the
1 four
1 boys
1 were
1 on
1 board
1 her
1 A
1 tiny
1 sail
1 was
1 set
1 and
1 the
1 boat
1 s
1 head
1 laid
1 towards
1 Ramsgate
1 I
1 am
1 glad
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 Master
1 Hargate
1 the
1 sailor
1 who
1 rowed
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 stroke
1 oars
1 shouted
1 He
1 was
1 the
1 man
1 who
1 had
1 lent
1 them
1 the
1 boat
1 I
1 was
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 looking
1 after
1 my
1 wife
1 who
1 is
1 sick
1 and
1 clean
1 forgot
1 you
1 till
1 it
1 was
1 dark
1 Then
1 I
1 ran
1 down
1 and
1 found
1 the
1 boat
1 hadn
1 t
1 returned
1 so
1 I
1 got
1 the
1 crew
1 together
1 and
1 we
1 came
1 out
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 you
1 though
1 we
1 had
1 little
1 hope
1 of
1 finding
1 you
1 It
1 was
1 lucky
1 for
1 you
1 we
1 did
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 them
1 too
1 for
1 so
1 it
1 chanced
1 that
1 we
1 were
1 but
1 half
1 a
1 mile
1 away
1 when
1 the
1 ship
1 fired
1 her
1 first
1 gun
1 just
1 as
1 we
1 had
1 given
1 you
1 up
1 and
1 determined
1 to
1 go
1 back
1 so
1 on
1 we
1 came
1 straight
1 here
1 Another
1 ten
1 minutes
1 and
1 we
1 should
1 have
1 been
1 too
1 late
1 e
1 are
1 making
1 for
1 Ramsgate
1 now
1 e
1 could
1 never
1 beat
1 back
1 to
1 Deal
1 in
1 this
1 wind
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 as
1 I
1 ever
1 saw
1 it
1 blow
1 much
1 harder
1 These
1 sentences
1 were
1 not
1 spoken
1 consecutively
1 but
1 were
1 shouted
1 out
1 in
1 the
1 intervals
1 between
1 gusts
1 of
1 wind
1 It
1 took
1 them
1 two
1 hours
1 to
1 beat
1 back
1 to
1 Ramsgate
1 a
1 signal
1 having
1 been
1 made
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 they
1 left
1 the
1 wreck
1 to
1 inform
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 there
1 and
1 at
1 Broadstairs
1 that
1 they
1 need
1 not
1 put
1 out
1 as
1 the
1 rescue
1 had
1 been
1 already
1 effected
1 The
1 lads
1 were
1 soon
1 put
1 to
1 bed
1 at
1 the
1 sailors
1 home
1 a
1 man
1 being
1 at
1 once
1 despatched
1 on
1 horseback
1 to
1 Deal
1 to
1 inform
1 those
1 there
1 of
1 the
1 arrival
1 of
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 and
1 of
1 the
1 rescue
1 of
1 the
1 four
1 boys
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 blown
1 to
1 sea
1 Early
1 next
1 morning
1 Frank
1 and
1 Handcock
1 returned
1 to
1 Deal
1 the
1 other
1 two
1 lads
1 being
1 so
1 exhausted
1 by
1 their
1 fatigue
1 and
1 exposure
1 that
1 the
1 doctor
1 said
1 they
1 had
1 better
1 remain
1 in
1 bed
1 for
1 another
1 twenty
1 -four
1 hours
1 It
1 is
1 impossible
1 to
1 describe
1 the
1 thankfulness
1 and
1 relief
1 which
1 Mrs
1 Hargate
1 experienced
1 when
1 about
1 two
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 himself
1 brought
1 her
1 news
1 of
1 the
1 safety
1 of
1 her
1 boy
1 She
1 had
1 long
1 given
1 up
1 all
1 hope
1 for
1 when
1 the
1 evening
1 came
1 on
1 and
1 Frank
1 had
1 not
1 returned
1 she
1 had
1 gone
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 shore
1 She
1 learned
1 from
1 the
1 fishermen
1 there
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 deemed
1 impossible
1 that
1 the
1 boys
1 could
1 reach
1 shore
1 in
1 face
1 of
1 the
1 gale
1 and
1 that
1 although
1 the
1 lifeboat
1 had
1 just
1 put
1 out
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 them
1 the
1 chances
1 of
1 their
1 being
1 found
1 were
1 as
1 she
1 herself
1 saw
1 faint
1 indeed
1 She
1 had
1 passed
1 the
1 hours
1 which
1 had
1 intervened
1 in
1 prayer
1 and
1 was
1 still
1 kneeling
1 by
1 her
1 bedside
1 where
1 little
1 Lucy
1 was
1 unconsciously
1 sleeping
1 when
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 s
1 knock
1 was
1 heard
1 at
1 the
1 door
1 Fervent
1 indeed
1 was
1 her
1 gratitude
1 to
1 God
1 for
1 the
1 almost
1 miraculous
1 preservation
1 of
1 her
1 son
1 s
1 life
1 and
1 then
1 overcome
1 by
1 the
1 emotions
1 she
1 had
1 experienced
1 she
1 sought
1 her
1 couch
1 and
1 was
1 still
1 asleep
1 when
1 by
1 the
1 earliest
1 train
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 Frank
1 returned
1 For
1 some
1 time
1 the
1 four
1 boys
1 were
1 the
1 heroes
1 of
1 the
1 school
1 A
1 subscription
1 was
1 got
1 up
1 to
1 pay
1 for
1 the
1 lost
1 boat
1 and
1 close
1 as
1 were
1 Mrs
1 Hargate
1 s
1 means
1 she
1 enabled
1 Frank
1 to
1 subscribe
1 his
1 share
1 towards
1 the
1 fund
1 The
1 incident
1 raised
1 Frank
1 to
1 a
1 pinnacle
1 of
1 popularity
1 among
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 for
1 the
1 three
1 others
1 were
1 unanimous
1 in
1 saying
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 his
1 coolness
1 and
1 skill
1 in
1 the
1 management
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 which
1 alone
1 kept
1 up
1 their
1 spirits
1 and
1 enabled
1 them
1 to
1 keep
1 her
1 afloat
1 during
1 the
1 gale
1 and
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 wreck
1 in
1 safety
1 In
1 the
1 general
1 enthusiasm
1 excited
1 by
1 the
1 event
1 Frank
1 s
1 pursuits
1 which
1 had
1 hitherto
1 found
1 few
1 followers
1 now
1 became
1 quite
1 popular
1 in
1 the
1 school
1 A
1 field
1 club
1 was
1 formed
1 of
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 elected
1 president
1 and
1 long
1 rambles
1 in
1 the
1 country
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 insects
1 and
1 plants
1 were
1 frequently
1 organized
1 Frank
1 himself
1 was
1 obliged
1 in
1 the
1 interests
1 of
1 the
1 school
1 to
1 moderate
1 the
1 zeal
1 of
1 the
1 naturalists
1 and
1 to
1 point
1 out
1 that
1 cricket
1 must
1 not
1 be
1 given
1 up
1 as
1 if
1 so
1 large
1 a
1 number
1 withdrew
1 themselves
1 from
1 the
1 game
1 the
1 school
1 would
1 suffer
1 disaster
1 in
1 its
1 various
1 engagements
1 with
1 other
1 schools
1 in
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 Consequently
1 the
1 rule
1 was
1 made
1 that
1 members
1 of
1 the
1 club
1 were
1 bound
1 to
1 be
1 in
1 the
1 cricket
1 field
1 on
1 at
1 least
1 three
1 days
1 in
1 the
1 week
1 including
1 one
1 half
1 holiday
1 while
1 they
1 were
1 free
1 to
1 ramble
1 in
1 the
1 country
1 on
1 other
1 days
1 This
1 wise
1 regulation
1 prevented
1 the
1 naturalists
1 from
1 becoming
1 unpopular
1 in
1 the
1 school
1 which
1 would
1 assuredly
1 have
1 been
1 the
1 case
1 had
1 they
1 entirely
1 absented
1 themselves
1 from
1 cricket
1 One
1 Saturday
1 afternoon
1 Frank
1 started
1 with
1 a
1 smaller
1 boy
1 who
1 was
1 one
1 of
1 his
1 most
1 devoted
1 followers
1 for
1 a
1 long
1 country
1 walk
1 Frank
1 carried
1 his
1 blowgun
1 and
1 a
1 butterfly
1 net
1 Charlie
1 Goodall
1 a
1 net
1 of
1 about
1 a
1 foot
1 in
1 depth
1 made
1 of
1 canvas
1 mounted
1 on
1 a
1 stout
1 brass
1 rim
1 and
1 strong
1 stick
1 for
1 the
1 capture
1 of
1 water
1 beetles
1 Their
1 pockets
1 bulged
1 with
1 bottles
1 and
1 tin
1 boxes
1 for
1 the
1 carriage
1 of
1 their
1 captured
1 prey
1 They
1 had
1 passed
1 through
1 Eastry
1 a
1 village
1 four
1 miles
1 from
1 Deal
1 when
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 There
1 is
1 a
1 green
1 hairstreak
1 The
1 first
1 I
1 ve
1 seen
1 this
1 year
1 I
1 have
1 never
1 caught
1 one
1 before
1 Cautiously
1 approaching
1 the
1 butterfly
1 who
1 was
1 sunning
1 himself
1 on
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 a
1 thistle
1 Frank
1 prepared
1 to
1 strike
1 when
1 it
1 suddenly
1 mounted
1 and
1 flitted
1 over
1 a
1 hedge
1 In
1 a
1 moment
1 the
1 boys
1 had
1 scrambled
1 through
1 the
1 gap
1 and
1 were
1 in
1 full
1 pursuit
1 The
1 butterfly
1 flitted
1 here
1 and
1 there
1 sometimes
1 allowing
1 the
1 boys
1 to
1 approach
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 feet
1 and
1 then
1 flitting
1 away
1 again
1 for
1 fifty
1 yards
1 without
1 stopping
1 Heedless
1 where
1 they
1 were
1 going
1 the
1 boys
1 pursued
1 till
1 they
1 were
1 startled
1 by
1 a
1 sudden
1 shout
1 close
1 to
1 them
1 You
1 young
1 rascals
1 how
1 dare
1 you
1 run
1 over
1 my
1 wheat
1 The
1 boys
1 stopped
1 and
1 Frank
1 saw
1 what
1 in
1 his
1 excitement
1 he
1 had
1 not
1 hitherto
1 heeded
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 now
1 running
1 in
1 a
1 field
1 of
1 wheat
1 which
1 reached
1 to
1 his
1 knee
1 I
1 am
1 very
1 sorry
1 sir
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 was
1 so
1 excited
1 than
1 I
1 really
1 did
1 not
1 see
1 where
1 I
1 was
1 going
1 Not
1 see
1 shouted
1 the
1 angry
1 farmer
1 You
1 young
1 rascal
1 I
1 ll
1 break
1 every
1 bone
1 in
1 your
1 body
1 and
1 he
1 flourished
1 a
1 heavy
1 stick
1 as
1 he
1 spoke
1 Charlie
1 Goodall
1 began
1 to
1 cry
1 I
1 have

1 have
1 no
1 right
1 to

1 My

1 now
1 shouted
1 the
1 farmer
1 as
1 he
1 advanced
1 with
1 uplifted
1 stick
1 Frank
1 slipped
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 of
1 his
1 clay
1 bullets
1 into
1 his
1 mouth
1 Leave
1 us
1 alone
1 or
1 it
1 will
1 be

1 for

1 he
1 said
1 as
1 he
1 raised
1 the
1 blowgun
1 to
1 his
1 mouth
1 The
1 farmer
1 advanced
1 and
1 Frank
1 sent
1 a
1 bullet
1 with
1 all
1 his
1 force
1 and
1 with
1 so
1 true
1 an
1 aim
1 that
1 he
1 struck
1 the
1 farmer
1 on
1 the
1 knuckles
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 sharp
1 blow
1 and
1 the
1 farmer
1 with
1 a
1 cry
1 of
1 pain
1 and
1 surprise
1 dropped
1 the
1 stick
1 Don
1 t
1 come
1 a
1 step
1 nearer
1 Frank
1 shouted
1 If
1 you
1 do
1 I
1 will
1 aim
1 at
1 your
1 eye
1 next
1 time
1 and
1 he
1 pointed
1 the
1 threatening
1 tube
1 at
1 the
1 enraged
1 farmer
1 s
1 face
1 I
1 ll
1 have
1 the
1 law
1 of
1 you
1 you
1 young
1 villain
1 I
1 ll
1 make
1 you
1 smart
1 for
1 this
1 You
1 can
1 do
1 as
1 you
1 like
1 about
1 that
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 only
1 struck
1 you
1 in
1 self
1 defense
1 and
1 have
1 let
1 you
1 off
1 easily
1 Come
1 along
1 Charlie
1 let
1 s
1 get
1 out
1 of
1 this
1 In
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 they
1 were
1 again
1 on
1 the
1 road
1 the
1 farmer
1 making
1 no
1 attempt
1 to
1 follow
1 them
1 but
1 determined
1 in
1 his
1 mind
1 to
1 drive
1 over
1 the
1 next
1 morning
1 to
1 Deal
1 to
1 take
1 out
1 a
1 summons
1 against
1 them
1 for
1 trespass
1 and
1 assault
1 The
1 lads
1 proceeded
1 silently
1 along
1 the
1 road
1 Frank
1 was
1 greatly
1 vexed
1 with
1 himself
1 at
1 his
1 carelessness
1 in
1 running
1 over
1 half
1 grown
1 wheat
1 and
1 was
1 meditating
1 how
1 he
1 could
1 pay
1 the
1 fine
1 without
1 having
1 to
1 ask
1 his
1 mother
1 He
1 determined
1 upon
1 his
1 return
1 to
1 carry
1 some
1 of
1 his
1 cases
1 of
1 stuffed
1 birds
1 down
1 to
1 a
1 shop
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 he
1 felt
1 sure
1 that
1 he
1 could
1 get
1 enough
1 for
1 these
1 to
1 pay
1 for
1 any
1 damage
1 which
1 could
1 have
1 been
1 inflicted
1 with
1 a
1 fine
1 for
1 trespassing
1 for
1 he
1 had
1 seen
1 stuffed
1 birds
1 exposed
1 in
1 the
1 windows
1 for
1 sale
1 which
1 were
1 he
1 was
1 sure
1 very
1 inferior
1 to
1 his
1 own
1 both
1 in
1 execution
1 and
1 lifelike
1 interest
1 After
1 proceeding
1 a
1 few
1 hundred
1 yards
1 along
1 the
1 road
1 they
1 met
1 a
1 pretty
1 little
1 girl
1 of
1 seven
1 or
1 eight
1 years
1 old
1 walking
1 along
1 alone
1 Frank
1 scarcely
1 glanced
1 at
1 her
1 for
1 at
1 the
1 moment
1 he
1 heard
1 a
1 shouting
1 in
1 the
1 distance
1 and
1 saw
1 some
1 men
1 running
1 along
1 the
1 road
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 he
1 thought
1 that
1 the
1 farmer
1 had
1 despatched
1 some
1 of
1 his
1 men
1 to
1 stop
1 him
1 but
1 instantly
1 dismissed
1 the
1 idea
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 coming
1 from
1 the
1 opposite
1 direction
1 and
1 could
1 by
1 no
1 possibility
1 have
1 heard
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 They
1 were
1 lost
1 sight
1 of
1 by
1 a
1 dip
1 in
1 the
1 road
1 and
1 as
1 they
1 disappeared
1 an
1 object
1 was
1 seen
1 on
1 the
1 road
1 on
1 the
1 near
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 dip
1 It
1 is
1 a
1 dog
1 Frank
1 said
1 hat
1 can
1 they
1 be
1 shouting
1 at
1 The
1 dog
1 was
1 within
1 fifty
1 yards
1 of
1 them
1 when
1 the
1 men
1 again
1 appeared
1 from
1 the
1 dip
1 and
1 recommenced
1 shouting
1 Frank
1 could
1 now
1 hear
1 what
1 they
1 said
1 Mad
1 dog
1 mad
1 dog
1 Get
1 through
1 the
1 hedge
1 Charlie
1 quick
1 Frank
1 cried
1 Here
1 I
1 will
1 help
1 you
1 over
1 never
1 mind
1 the
1 thorns
1 The
1 hedge
1 was
1 low
1 and
1 closely
1 kept
1 and
1 Frank
1 bundling
1 his
1 comrade
1 over
1 it
1 threw
1 himself
1 across
1 and
1 looked
1 round
1 The
1 dog
1 was
1 within
1 ten
1 yards
1 of
1 them
1 and
1 Frank
1 saw
1 that
1 the
1 alarm
1 was
1 well
1 founded
1 The
1 dog
1 was
1 a
1 large
1 crossbred
1 animal
1 between
1 a
1 mastiff
1 and
1 a
1 bulldog
1 Its
1 hair
1 was
1 rough
1 and
1 bristling
1 It
1 came
1 along
1 with
1 its
1 head
1 down
1 and
1 foam
1 churning
1 from
1 its
1 mouth
1 Frank
1 looked
1 the
1 other
1 way
1 and
1 gave
1 a
1 cry
1 Yet
1 twenty
1 yards
1 off
1 in
1 the
1 middle
1 of
1 the
1 road
1 stood
1 the
1 child
1 She
1 too
1 had
1 heard
1 the
1 shouts
1 and
1 had
1 paused
1 to
1 see
1 what
1 was
1 the
1 matter
1 She
1 had
1 not
1 taken
1 the
1 alarm
1 but
1 stood
1 unsuspicious
1 of
1 danger
1 watching
1 not
1 the
1 dog
1 but
1 the
1 men
1 in
1 the
1 distance
1 Frank
1 placed
1 the
1 blowgun
1 to
1 his
1 mouth
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 moment
1 his
1 pellet
1 struck
1 the
1 animal
1 smartly
1 on
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 head
1 It
1 gave
1 a
1 short
1 yelp
1 and
1 paused
1 Another
1 shot
1 struck
1 it
1 and
1 then
1 Frank
1 snatching
1 the
1 water
1 net
1 from
1 Charlie
1 threw
1 himself
1 over
1 the
1 hedge
1 and
1 placed
1 himself
1 between
1 the
1 child
1 and
1 the
1 dog
1 just
1 as
1 the
1 latter
1 with
1 a
1 savage
1 growl
1 rushed
1 at
1 him
1 Frank
1 stood
1 perfectly
1 cool
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 animal
1 rushed
1 forward
1 thrust
1 the
1 net
1 over
1 its
1 head
1 the
1 ring
1 was
1 but
1 just
1 large
1 enough
1 to
1 allow
1 its
1 head
1 to
1 enter
1 Frank
1 at
1 once
1 sprang
1 forward
1 and
1 placing
1 himself
1 behind
1 the
1 dog
1 kept
1 a
1 strain
1 upon
1 the
1 stick
1 so
1 retaining
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 net
1 tightly
1 on
1 his
1 neck
1 The
1 animal
1 at
1 first
1 rushed
1 forward
1 dragging
1 Frank
1 after
1 him
1 Then
1 he
1 stopped
1 backed
1 and
1 tried
1 to
1 withdraw
1 his
1 head
1 from
1 the
1 encumbrance
1 which
1 blinded
1 him
1 Frank
1 however
1 had
1 no
1 difficulty
1 in
1 retaining
1 the
1 canvas
1 net
1 in
1 its
1 place
1 until
1 the
1 men
1 who
1 were
1 armed
1 with
1 pitchforks
1 ran
1 up
1 and
1 speedily
1 despatched
1 the
1 unfortunate
1 animal
1 That
1 s
1 bravely
1 done
1 young
1 master
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 said
1 and
1 you
1 have
1 saved
1 missy
1 s
1 life
1 surely
1 The
1 savage
1 brute
1 rushed
1 into
1 the
1 yard
1 and
1 bit
1 a
1 young
1 colt
1 and
1 a
1 heifer
1 and
1 then
1 as
1 we
1 came
1 running
1 out
1 with
1 forks
1 he
1 took
1 to
1 the
1 road
1 again
1 e
1 chased
1 um
1 along
1 not
1 knowing
1 who
1 we
1 might
1 meet
1 and
1 it
1 gived
1 us
1 a
1 rare
1 turn
1 when
1 we
1 saw
1 the
1 master
1 s
1 Bessy
1 standing
1 alone
1 in
1 the
1 road
1 wi
1 nout
1 between
1 her
1 and
1 the
1 dog
1 here
1 have
1 you
1 been
1 Miss
1 Bessy
1 I
1 ve
1 been
1 to
1 aunt
1 s
1 she
1 said
1 and
1 she
1 gave
1 me
1 some
1 strawberries
1 and
1 cream
1 and
1 it
1 s
1 wicked
1 of
1 you
1 to
1 kill
1 the
1 poor
1 dog
1 Her
1 aunt
1 s
1 farm
1 lies
1 next
1 to
1 master
1 s
1 the
1 man
1 explained
1 and
1 little
1 miss
1 often
1 goes
1 over
1 there
1 The
1 dog
1 was
1 mad
1 missy
1 and
1 if
1 it
1 hadn
1 t
1 been
1 for
1 young
1 master
1 here
1 it
1 would
1 have
1 killed
1 you
1 as
1 safe
1 as
1 eggs
1 on
1 t
1 you
1 come
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 farm
1 sir
1 Master

1 to
1 thank
1 you
1 for
1 having
1 saved
1 missy
1 s
1 life
1 No
1 thank
1 you
1 Frank
1 said
1 we
1 are
1 late
1 now
1 and
1 must
1 be
1 going
1 on
1 our
1 way
1 I
1 am
1 very
1 glad
1 I
1 happened
1 to
1 be
1 here
1 at
1 the
1 time
1 so
1 saying
1 Frank
1 and
1 Charlie
1 proceeded
1 on
1 their
1 way
1 to
1 Deal
1 On
1 reaching
1 home
1 he
1 at
1 once
1 picked
1 out
1 four
1 of
1 his
1 best
1 cases
1 of
1 stuffed
1 birds
1 The
1 cases
1 he
1 had
1 constructed
1 himself
1 for
1 his
1 father
1 had
1 encouraged
1 him
1 to
1 depend
1 upon
1 himself
1 for
1 his
1 amusements
1 He
1 had
1 asked
1 Charlie
1 to
1 come
1 round
1 to
1 help
1 him
1 to
1 carry
1 the
1 cases
1 and
1 with
1 these
1 he
1 proceeded
1 to
1 a
1 shop
1 where
1 he
1 had
1 seen
1 such
1 things
1 offered
1 for
1 sale
1 And
1 you
1 really
1 did
1 these
1 yourself
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 in
1 surprise
1 They
1 are
1 beautifully
1 done
1 Quite
1 pictures
1 I
1 call
1 them
1 It
1 is
1 a
1 pity
1 that
1 they
1 are
1 homely
1 birds
1 There
1 is
1 no
1 great
1 sale
1 for
1 such
1 things
1 here
1 I
1 cannot
1 give
1 you
1 more
1 than
1 five
1 shillings
1 each
1 but
1 if
1 you
1 had
1 them
1 in
1 London
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 worth
1 a
1 great
1 deal
1 more
1 Frank
1 gladly
1 accepted
1 the
1 offer
1 and
1 feeling
1 sure
1 that
1 the
1 pound
1 would
1 cover
1 the
1 damage
1 done
1 and
1 the
1 fine
1 which
1 might
1 be
1 five
1 shillings
1 apiece
1 for
1 trespassing
1 went
1 home
1 in
1 good
1 spirits
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 the
1 doctor
1 was
1 called
1 out
1 in

1 with
1 whom
1 they
1 had
1 had
1 the
1 altercation
1 on
1 the
1 previous
1 day
1 Frank
1 felt
1 his
1 cheeks
1 flush
1 as
1 he
1 anticipated
1 a
1 severe
1 reprimand
1 before
1 the
1 whole
1 school
1 Mr
1 Gregson
1 the
1 doctor
1 said
1 tells

1 men
1 who

1 have
1 thrown
1 themselves
1 in
1 the
1 way
1 of
1 a
1 mad
1 dog
1 for
1 the
1 sake
1 of
1 a

1 Three
1 such
1 thundering
1 cheers
1 as
1 those
1 which
1 arose
1 had
1 never
1 been
1 heard
1 within
1 the
1 limits
1 of
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 s
1 school
1 from
1 the
1 day
1 of
1 its
1 foundation
1 Seeing
1 that
1 farther
1 work
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 expected
1 from
1 them
1 after
1 this
1 excitement
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 gave
1 the
1 boys
1 a
1 holiday
1 for
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 and
1 they
1 poured
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 schoolroom
1 shouting
1 and
1 delighted
1 while
1 Frank
1 was
1 taken
1 off
1 to
1 the
1 parlor
1 to
1 be
1 thanked
1 by
1 Mrs
1 Gregson
1 The
1 farmer
1 closed
1 his
1 visit
1 by
1 inviting
1 Frank
1 with
1 as
1 many
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 as
1 he
1 liked
1 -
1 -the
1 whole
1 school
1 if
1 they
1 would

1 the
1 better
1 -
1 -to
1 come
1 over
1 to
1 tea
1 on
1 the
1 following
1 Saturday
1 afternoon
1 and
1 he
1 promised
1 them
1 as
1 much
1 strawberries
1 and
1 cream
1 as
1 they
1 could
1 eat
1 The
1 invitation
1 was
1 largely
1 accepted
1 and
1 the
1 boys
1 all
1 agreed
1 that
1 a
1 jollier
1 meal
1 they
1 never
1 sat
1 down
1 to
1 than
1 that
1 which
1 was
1 spread
1 on
1 tables
1 in
1 the
1 farmer
1 s
1 garden
1 The
1 meal
1 was
1 called
1 tea
1 but
1 it
1 might
1 have
1 been
1 a
1 dinner
1 for
1 the
1 tables
1 were
1 laden
1 with
1 huge
1 pies
1 cold
1 chicken
1 and
1 duck
1 hams
1 and
1 piles
1 of
1 cakes
1 and
1 tarts
1 of
1 all
1 sorts
1 Before
1 they
1 started
1 for
1 home
1 late
1 in
1 the
1 evening
1 syllabub
1 and
1 cake
1 were
1 handed
1 round
1 and
1 the
1 boys
1 tramped
1 back
1 to
1 Deal
1 in
1 the
1 highest
1 of
1 glee
1 at
1 the
1 entertainment
1 they
1 had
1 received
1 from
1 the
1 hospitable
1 farmer
1 and
1 his
1 wife
1 Great
1 fun
1 had
1 been
1 caused
1 after
1 tea
1 by
1 the
1 farmer
1 giving
1 a
1 humorous
1 relation
1 of
1 the
1 battle
1 with
1 which
1 his
1 acquaintance
1 with
1 Frank
1 had
1 commenced
1 and
1 especially
1 at

1 threat
1 of

1 to
1 send
1 a
1 bullet
1 into
1 his
1 eye
1 if
1 he
1 interfered
1 with

1 hen
1 they
1 left
1 a

1 cordial
1 invitation
1 was
1 given
1 to

1 to

1 over
1 with

1 close
1 shave
1 the
1 other
1 night
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 boatmen
1 remarked
1 to
1 Frank
1 as
1 a
1 few
1 days
1 after
1 the
1 adventure
1 he
1 strolled
1 down
1 with
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 Handcock
1 to
1 talk
1 to
1 the
1 boatman
1 whose
1 boat
1 had
1 been
1 lost
1 a
1 very
1 narrow
1 shave
1 I
1 had
1 one
1 out
1 there
1 myself
1 when
1 I
1 was
1 just
1 about
1 your
1 age
1 nigh
1 forty
1 years
1 ago
1 I
1 went
1 out
1 for
1 a
1 sail
1 with
1 my
1 father
1 in
1 his
1 fishing
1 boat
1 and
1 I
1 didn
1 t
1 come
1 back
1 for
1 three
1 years
1 That
1 was
1 the
1 only
1 long
1 voyage
1 I
1 ever
1 went
1 I
1 ve
1 been
1 sticking
1 to
1 fishing
1 ever
1 since
1 How
1 was
1 it
1 you

1 the
1 adventure
1 Tell

1 ell
1 it
1 s
1 rather
1 a
1 long
1 yarn
1 the
1 boatman
1 said
1 ell
1 your
1 best
1 plan
1 Jack
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 putting

1 and
1 bringing
1 out
1 sixpence
1 will
1 be
1 for
1 you
1 to
1 go
1 across
1 the
1 road
1 and
1 wet
1 your
1 whistle
1 before
1 you
1 begin
1 Thank
1 ye
1 young
1 gentleman
1 I
1 will
1 take
1 three
1 o
1 grog
1 and
1 an
1 ounce
1 of
1 bacca
1 He
1 went
1 across
1 to
1 the
1 public
1 house
1 and
1 soon
1 returned
1 with
1 a
1 long
1 clay
1 in
1 his
1 hand
1 Then
1 he
1 sat
1 down
1 on
1 the
1 shingle
1 with
1 his
1 back
1 against
1 a
1 boat
1 and
1 the
1 boys
1 threw
1 themselves
1 down
1 close
1 to
1 him
1 Now
1 he
1 began
1 when
1 he
1 had
1 filled
1 his
1 pipe
1 with
1 great
1 deliberation
1 and
1 got
1 it
1 fairly
1 alight
1 this
1 here
1 yarn
1 as
1 I
1 m
1 going
1 to
1 tell
1 you
1 ain
1 t
1 no
1 gammon
1 Most
1 of
1 the
1 tales
1 which
1 gets
1 told
1 on

1 to
1 visitors
1 as
1 comes
1 down
1 here
1 and
1 wants
1 to
1 hear
1 of
1 sea
1 adventures
1 is
1 just
1 lies
1 from
1 beginning
1 to
1 end
1 Now
1 I
1 ain
1 t
1 that
1 sort
1 leastways
1 I
1 shouldn
1 t
1 go
1 to
1 impose
1 upon
1 young
1 gents
1 like
1 you
1 as
1 ha
1 had
1 a
1 real
1 adventure
1 of
1 your
1 own
1 and
1 showed
1 oncommon
1 good
1 pluck
1 and
1 coolness
1 too
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 say
1 mind
1 ye
1 that
1 every
1 word
1 is
1 just
1 gospel
1 My
1 mates
1 as
1 ha
1 known
1 me
1 from
1 a
1 boy
1 tells
1 me
1 that
1 I
1 ve
1 bellished
1 the
1 yarn
1 since
1 I
1 first
1 told
1 it
1 and
1 that
1 all
1 sorts
1 of
1 things
1 have
1 crept
1 in
1 which
1 wasn
1 t
1 there
1 first
1 That
1 may
1 be
1 so
1 hen
1 a
1 man
1 tells
1 a
1 story
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 times
1 naturally
1 he
1 can
1 t
1 always
1 tell
1 it
1 just
1 the
1 same
1 and
1 he
1 gets
1 so
1 mixed
1 up
1 atween
1 what
1 he
1 told
1 last
1 and
1 what
1 he
1 told
1 first
1 that
1 he
1 don
1 t
1 rightly
1 know
1 which
1 was
1 which
1 when
1 he
1 wants
1 to
1 tell
1 it
1 just
1 as
1 it
1 really
1 happened
1 So
1 if
1 sometimes
1 it
1 appears
1 to
1 you
1 that
1 I
1 m
1 steering
1 rather
1 wild
1 just
1 you
1 put
1 a
1 stopper
1 on
1 and
1 bring
1 me
1 up
1 all
1 standing
1 with
1 a
1 question
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 quiet
1 humor
1 about
1 the
1 boatman
1 s
1 face
1 and
1 the
1 boys
1 winked
1 at
1 each
1 other
1 as
1 much
1 as
1 to
1 say
1 that
1 after
1 such
1 an
1 exordium
1 they
1 must
1 expect
1 something
1 rather
1 staggering
1 The
1 boatman
1 took
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 hard
1 whiffs
1 at
1 his
1 pipe
1 and
1 then
1 began
1 It
1 was
1 towards
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 September
1 in
1 1
1 8
1 3
1 2
1 that
1 s
1 just
1 forty
1 years
1 ago
1 now
1 that
1 I
1 went
1 out
1 with
1 my
1 father
1 and
1 three
1 hands
1 in
1 the
1 smack
1 the
1 Flying
1 Dolphin
1 I
1 d
1 been
1 at
1 sea
1 with
1 father
1 off
1 and
1 on
1 ever
1 since
1 I
1 was
1 about
1 nine
1 years
1 old
1 and
1 a
1 smarter
1 boy
1 wasn
1 t
1 to
1 be
1 found
1 on
1 the
1 beach
1 The
1 Dolphin
1 was
1 a
1 good
1 sea
1 boat
1 but
1 she
1 wasn
1 t
1 so
1 to
1 say
1 fast
1 and
1 I
1 dunno
1 as
1 she
1 was
1 much
1 to
1 look
1 at
1 for
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 wasn
1 t
1 the
1 sort
1 of
1 chap
1 to
1 chuck
1 away
1 his
1 money
1 in
1 paint
1 or
1 in
1 new
1 sails
1 as
1 long
1 as
1 the
1 old
1 ones
1 could
1 be
1 pieced
1 and
1 patched
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 hold
1 the
1 wind
1 e
1 sailed
1 out
1 pretty
1 nigh
1 over
1 to
1 the
1 French
1 coast
1 and
1 good
1 sport
1 we
1 had
1 e
1 d
1 been
1 out
1 two
1 days
1 when
1 we
1 turned
1 her
1 head
1 homewards
1 The
1 wind
1 was
1 blowing
1 pretty
1 strong
1 and
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 remarked
1 he
1 thought
1 we
1 was
1 in
1 for
1 a
1 gale
1 There
1 was
1 some
1 talk
1 of
1 our
1 running
1 in
1 to
1 Calais
1 and
1 waiting
1 till
1 it
1 had
1 blown
1 itself
1 out
1 but
1 the
1 fish
1 might
1 have
1 spoil
1 before
1 the
1 ind
1 dropped
1 so
1 we
1 made
1 up
1 our
1 minds
1 to
1 run
1 straight
1 into
1 Dover
1 and
1 send
1 the
1 fish
1 up
1 from
1 there
1 The
1 night
1 came
1 on
1 wild
1 and
1 squally
1 and
1 as
1 dark
1 as
1 pitch
1 It
1 might
1 be
1 about
1 eight
1 bells
1 and
1 I
1 and
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 hands
1 had
1 turned
1 in
1 when
1 father
1 gave
1 a
1 sudden
1 shout
1 down
1 the
1 hatch
1 All
1 hands
1 on
1 deck
1 I
1 was
1 next
1 to
1 the
1 steps
1 and
1 sprang
1 up
1 em
1 Just
1 as
1 I
1 got
1 to
1 the
1 top
1 something
1 grazed
1 my
1 face
1 I
1 caught
1 at
1 it
1 not
1 knowing
1 what
1 it
1 was
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 moment
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 crash
1 and
1 the
1 Dolphin
1 went
1 away
1 from
1 under
1 my
1 feet
1 I
1 clung
1 for
1 bare
1 life
1 scarce
1 awake
1 yet
1 nor
1 knowing
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 The
1 next
1 moment
1 I
1 was
1 under
1 water
1 I
1 still
1 held
1 on
1 to
1 the
1 rope
1 and
1 was
1 soon
1 out
1 again
1 By
1 this
1 time
1 I
1 was
1 pretty
1 well
1 awake
1 to
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 A
1 ship
1 running
1 down
1 channel
1 had
1 walked
1 clean
1 over
1 the
1 poor
1 old
1 Dolphin
1 and
1 I
1 had
1 got
1 hold
1 of
1 the
1 bobstay
1 It
1 took
1 me
1 some
1 time
1 to
1 climb
1 up
1 on
1 to
1 the
1 bowsprit
1 for
1 every
1 time
1 she
1 pitched
1 I
1 went
1 under
1 water
1 However
1 I
1 got
1 up
1 at
1 last
1 and
1 swarmed
1 along
1 the
1 bowsprit
1 and
1 got
1 on
1 board
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 chap
1 sitting
1 down
1 fast
1 asleep
1 there
1 I
1 walked
1 aft
1 to
1 the
1 helmsman
1 Two
1 men
1 were
1 pacing
1 up
1 and
1 down
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 him
1 You
1 re
1 a
1 nice
1 lot
1 you
1 are
1 I
1 said
1 to
1 go
1 running
1 down
1 Channel
1 at
1 ten
1 knots
1 an
1 hour
1 without
1 any
1 watch

1 the
1 law
1 of

1 if
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 Jeerusalem
1 said
1 one
1 who
1 have
1 we
1 here
1 My
1 name
1 is
1 Jack
1 Perkins
1 says
1 I
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 the
1 sole
1 survivor
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 I
1 knows
1 of
1 the
1 smack
1 the
1 Flying
1 Dolphin
1 as
1 has
1 been
1 run
1 down
1 by

1 Darn
1 the
1 Flying
1 Dolphin
1 and
1 you

1 says
1 the
1 man
1 and
1 he
1 begins
1 to
1 walk
1 up
1 and
1 down
1 the
1 deck
1 a
1 -puffn
1 of
1 a
1 long
1 cigar
1 as
1 if
1 nothing
1 had
1 happened
1 Oh
1 come
1 says
1 I
1 this
1 won
1 t
1 do
1 Here
1 you
1 ve
1 been
1 and
1 run
1 down
1 a
1 smack
1 drowned
1 father
1 and
1 the
1 other
1 three
1 hands
1 and
1 your
1 lookout
1 fast
1 asleep
1 and
1 you
1 does
1 nothing
1 I
1 suppose
1 said
1 the
1 captain
1 sarcastic
1 you
1 want
1 me
1 to
1 jump
1 over
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 em
1 You
1 want
1 me
1 to
1 heave
1 the
1 ship
1 to
1 in
1 this
1 gale
1 and
1 to
1 invite
1 yer
1 father
1 perlitely
1 to
1 come
1 on
1 board
1 P
1 raps
1 you
1 d
1 like
1 a
1 grapnel
1 put
1 out
1 to

1 if
1 I
1 couldn
1 t
1 hook
1 the
1 smack
1 and
1 bring
1 her
1 up
1 again
1 Perhaps
1 you
1 d
1 like
1 to
1 be
1 chucked
1 overboard
1 yourself
1 Nobody
1 asked
1 you
1 to
1 come
1 on
1 board
1 nobody
1 wanted
1 your
1 company
1 I
1 reckon
1 the
1 wisest
1 thing
1 you
1 can
1 do
1 is
1 to
1 go
1 for
1 ard
1 and
1 turn
1 in
1 There
1 didn
1 t
1 seem
1 much
1 for
1 me
1 to
1 do
1 else
1 so
1 I
1 went
1 forward
1 to
1 the
1 forecastle
1 There
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 hands
1 were
1 asleep
1 but
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 were
1 sitting
1 up
1 yarning
1 I
1 told
1 em
1 my
1 story
1 and
1 what
1 this
1 captain
1 had
1 said
1 He
1 s
1 a
1 queer
1 hand
1 is
1 the
1 skipper
1 one
1 of
1 em
1 said
1 and
1 hasn
1 t
1 got
1 a
1 soft
1 place

1 ell
1 my
1 lad
1 I
1 daresay
1 the
1 skipper
1 will
1 do
1 that
1 but
1 as
1 we
1 re
1 bound
1 for
1 the

1 you

1 as
1 I

1 a
1 long
1 voyage
1 before
1 you
1 If
1 the
1 weather
1 had
1 been
1 fine
1 the
1 skipper
1 might
1 have
1 spoken
1 some
1 ship
1 in
1 the
1 Channel
1 and
1 put
1 you
1 on

1 but

1 we

1 of
1 miles
1 at

1 Even
1 if
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 fine
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 suppose
1 the
1 skipper
1 would
1 have
1 parted
1 with
1 you
1 especially
1 if
1 you
1 told
1 him
1 the
1 watch
1 was
1 asleep
1 He
1 would
1 not
1 care
1 next
1 time
1 he
1 entered
1 an
1 English
1 port
1 to
1 have
1 a
1 claim
1 fixed
1 on
1 his
1 ship
1 for
1 the
1 vally
1 of
1 the
1 smack
1 I
1 saw
1 what
1 the
1 sailor
1 said
1 was
1 like
1 enough
1 and
1 blamed
1 myself
1 for
1 having
1 let
1 out
1 about
1 the
1 watch
1 However
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 help
1 for
1 it
1 and
1 I
1 turned
1 into
1 an
1 empty
1 bunk
1 and
1 cried
1 myself
1 to
1 sleep
1 hat
1 a
1 voyage
1 that
1 was
1 to
1 be
1 sure
1 The
1 ship
1 was
1 a
1 Yankee
1 and
1 so
1 was
1 the
1 master
1 and
1 mates
1 The
1 crew
1 were
1 of
1 all
1 sorts
1 Dutch
1 and
1 Swedes
1 and
1 English
1 a
1 Yank
1 or
1 two
1 and
1 a
1 sprinklin
1 of
1 niggers
1 It
1 was
1 one
1 of
1 those
1 ships
1 they
1 call
1 a
1 hell
1 on
1 earth
1 and
1 cussing
1 and
1 kicking
1 and
1 driving
1 went
1 on
1 all
1 day
1 I
1 hadn
1 t
1 no
1 regular
1 place
1 give
1 me
1 but
1 helped
1 the
1 black
1 cook
1 and
1 pulled
1 at
1 ropes
1 and
1 swabbed
1 the
1 decks
1 and
1 got
1 kicked
1 and
1 cuffed
1 all
1 round
1 The
1 skipper
1 did
1 not
1 often
1 speak
1 to
1 me
1 but
1 when
1 his
1 eye
1 lighted
1 on
1 me
1 he
1 gave
1 an
1 ugly
1 sort
1 of
1 look
1 as
1 seemed
1 to
1 say
1 You
1 d
1 better
1 ha
1 gone
1 down
1 with
1 the
1 others
1 You
1 think
1 you
1 re
1 going
1 to
1 report
1 the
1 loss
1 of
1 the
1 smack
1 and
1 to
1 get
1 damages
1 against
1 the
1 Potomac
1 do
1 you
1 we
1 shall
1 see
1 The
1 crew
1 were
1 a
1 rough
1 lot
1 but
1 the
1 spirit
1 seemed
1 taken
1 out
1 of
1 em
1 by
1 the
1 treatment
1 they
1 met
1 with
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 word
1 and
1 a
1 blow
1 with
1 the
1 mates
1 and
1 they
1 would
1 think
1 no
1 more
1 of
1 catching
1 up
1 a
1 handspike
1 and
1 stretching
1 a
1 man
1 senseless
1 on
1 the
1 deck
1 than
1 I
1 should
1 of
1 killing
1 a
1 fly
1 There
1 was
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 among
1 em
1 of
1 a
1 better
1 sort
1 than
1 the
1 others
1 The
1 best
1 of
1 em
1 was
1 the
1 carpenter
1 an
1 old
1 Dutchman
1 Leetle
1 boy
1 he
1 used
1 to
1 say
1 to
1 me

1 Boy
1 killed
1 by
1 accident
1 I
1 felt
1 that
1 this
1 was
1 so
1 myself
1 and
1 I
1 did
1 my
1 work
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 I
1 could
1 One
1 day
1 however
1 when
1 we
1 were
1 near
1 the
1 line
1 I
1 happened
1 to
1 upset
1 a
1 bucket
1 with
1 some
1 tar
1 The
1 captain
1 was
1 standing
1 close
1 by
1 You
1 young
1 dog
1 he
1 said
1 you

1 done
1 that
1 a
1 purpose
1 and
1 before
1 I
1 could
1 speak
1 he
1 caught
1 up
1 the
1 bucket
1 by
1 the
1 handle
1 and
1 brought
1 it
1 down
1 on
1 my
1 head
1 with
1 all
1 his
1 might
1 The
1 next
1 thing
1 I
1 remember
1 was
1 I
1 was
1 lying
1 in
1 a
1 bunk
1 in
1 the
1 forecastle
1 Everything
1 looked
1 strange
1 to
1 me
1 and
1 I
1 couldn
1 t
1 raise
1 my
1 head
1 After
1 a
1 time
1 I
1 made
1 shift
1 to
1 turn
1 it
1 round
1 and
1 saw
1 old
1 Jans
1 sitting
1 on
1 a
1 chest
1 mending
1 a
1 jacket
1 I
1 called
1 him
1 but
1 my

1 Ah

1 strong
1 before

1 For
1 another
1 three
1 weeks
1 I
1 lay
1 in
1 my
1 bunk
1 I
1 only
1 ate
1 a
1 little
1 gruel
1 when
1 others
1 were
1 there
1 but
1 when
1 the
1 skipper
1 was
1 at
1 dinner
1 Jans
1 would
1 bring
1 me
1 strong
1 soup
1 and
1 meat
1 from

1 caboose
1 The
1 captain
1 came
1 several
1 times
1 and
1 shook
1 me
1 and
1 swore
1 I
1 was
1 shamming
1 but
1 I
1 only
1 answered
1 in
1 a
1 whisper
1 and
1 seemed
1 as
1 faint
1 as
1 a
1 girl
1 All
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 Potomac
1 was
1 making
1 good
1 way
1 and
1 was
1 running
1 fast
1 down
1 the
1 coast
1 of
1 South
1 America
1 The
1 air
1 was
1 getting
1 cool
1 and
1 fresh
1 I
1 tink
1 Jans
1 said
1 one
1 evening
1 to
1 me
1 dat
1 dis
1 not
1 go
1 on
1 much
1 much
1 longer
1 De
1 crew
1 getting
1 desperate
1 Dey
1 talk
1 and
1 mutter
1 among
1 demselves
1 Me
1 thinks
1 we
1 have
1 trouble
1 before
1 long
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 mates
1 came
1 in
1 with
1 a
1 bucket
1 of
1 water
1 There
1 you
1 skulking
1 young
1 hound
1 he
1 said
1 as
1 he
1 threw
1 it
1 over
1 me
1 you
1 d
1 best
1 get
1 out
1 or
1 the
1 skipper
1 will
1 come
1 and
1 rouse
1 you
1 up
1 himself
1 I
1 staggered
1 on
1 to
1 the
1 floor
1 I
1 had
1 made
1 up
1 my
1 mind
1 to
1 sham
1 weak
1 but
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 need
1 to
1 pretend
1 at
1 first
1 for
1 having
1 been
1 six
1 weeks
1 in
1 bed
1 I
1 felt
1 strange
1 and
1 giddy
1 when
1 I
1 got
1 up
1 I
1 slipped
1 on
1 my
1 clothes
1 and
1 went
1 out
1 on
1 deck
1 staggered
1 to
1 the
1 bulwarks
1 and
1 held
1 on
1 The
1 fresh
1 air
1 soon
1 set
1 me
1 straight
1 and
1 I
1 felt
1 that
1 I
1 was
1 pretty
1 strong
1 again
1 However
1 I
1 pretended
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 scarce
1 stand
1 and
1 holding
1 on
1 by
1 the
1 bulwark
1 made
1 my
1 way
1 aft
1 You
1 young
1 dog
1 the
1 skipper
1 said
1 you
1 ve
1 been
1 shamming
1 for
1 the
1 last
1 six
1 weeks
1 I
1 reckon
1 I
1 ll
1 sharpen
1 you
1 up
1 now
1 and
1 he
1 hit
1 me
1 a
1 heavy
1 blow
1 with
1 a
1 rattan
1 he
1 held
1 in
1 his
1 hand
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 cry
1 of
1 Shame
1 from
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 As
1 quick
1 as
1 thought
1 the
1 skipper
1 pulled
1 a
1 pistol
1 from
1 his
1 pocket
1 ho
1 cried
1 Shame
1 he
1 asked
1 looking
1 round
1 No
1 one
1 answered
1 Still
1 holding
1 the
1 pistol
1 in
1 his
1 hand
1 he
1 gave
1 me
1 several
1 more
1 cuts
1 and
1 then
1 told
1 me
1 to
1 swab
1 the
1 deck
1 I
1 did
1 it
1 pretending
1 all
1 the
1 time
1 I
1 was
1 scarce
1 strong
1 enough
1 to
1 keep
1 my
1 feet
1 Then
1 I
1 made
1 my
1 way
1 forward
1 and
1 sat
1 down
1 against
1 the
1 bulwark
1 as
1 if
1 nigh
1 done
1 up
1 till
1 night
1 came
1 That
1 night
1 as
1 I
1 lay
1 in
1 my
1 bunk
1 I
1 heard
1 the
1 men
1 talking
1 in
1 whispers
1 together
1 I
1 judged
1 from
1 what
1 they
1 said
1 that
1 they
1 intended
1 to
1 wait
1 for
1 another
1 week
1 when
1 they
1 expected
1 to
1 enter
1 Magellan
1 Straits
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 attack
1 and
1 throw
1 the
1 officers
1 overboard
1 Nothing
1 seemed
1 settled
1 as
1 to
1 what
1 they
1 would
1 do
1 afterwards
1 Some
1 were
1 in
1 favor
1 of
1 continuing
1 the
1 voyage
1 to
1 port
1 and
1 there
1 giving
1 out
1 that
1 the
1 captain
1 and
1 officers
1 had
1 been
1 washed
1 overboard
1 in
1 a
1 storm
1 when
1 if
1 all
1 stood
1 true
1 to
1 each
1 other
1 the
1 truth
1 could
1 never
1 be
1 known
1 although
1 suspicions
1 might
1 arise
1 The
1 others
1 however
1 insisted
1 that
1 you
1 never
1 could
1 be
1 sure
1 of
1 every
1 one
1 and
1 that
1 some
1 one
1 would
1 be
1 sure
1 to
1 peach
1 They
1 argued
1 in
1 favor
1 of
1 sailing
1 west
1 and
1 beaching
1 the
1 ship
1 on
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Pacific
1 islands
1 where
1 they
1 could
1 live
1 comfortably
1 and
1 take
1 wives
1 among
1 the
1 native
1 women
1 If
1 they
1 were
1 ever
1 found
1 they
1 could
1 then
1 say
1 that
1 the
1 ship
1 was
1 blown
1 out
1 of
1 her
1 course
1 and
1 wrecked
1 there
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 captain
1 and
1 officers
1 had
1 been
1 drowned
1 or
1 killed
1 by
1 the
1 natives
1 It
1 seemed
1 to
1 me
1 that
1 this
1 party
1 were
1 the
1 strongest
1 For
1 the
1 next
1 week
1 I
1 was
1 thrashed
1 and
1 kicked
1 every
1 day
1 and
1 had
1 I
1 been
1 as
1 weak
1 as
1 I
1 pretended
1 to
1 be
1 I
1 m
1 sure
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 killed
1 me
1 However
1 thanks
1 to
1 the
1 food
1 Jans
1 brought
1 me
1 for
1 I
1 was
1 put
1 on
1 bread
1 and
1 water
1 I
1 held
1 on
1 At
1 last
1 we
1 entered
1 the
1 straits
1 The
1 men
1 were
1 very
1 quiet
1 that
1 day
1 and
1 the
1 captain
1 in
1 a
1 worse
1 temper
1 than
1 usual
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 go
1 to
1 sleep
1 and
1 turned
1 out
1 at
1 the
1 midnight
1 watch
1 for
1 I
1 was
1 made
1 to
1 keep
1 watch
1 although
1 I
1 was
1 on
1 duty
1 all
1 day
1 As
1 the
1 watch
1 came
1 in
1 I
1 heard
1 them
1 say
1 to
1 the
1 others
1 In
1 ten
1 minutes
1 time
1 Presently
1 I
1 saw
1 them
1 come
1 out
1 and
1 joining
1 the
1 watch
1 on
1 deck
1 they
1 went
1 aft
1 quietly
1 in
1 a
1 body
1 They
1 had
1 all
1 got
1 handspikes
1 in
1 their
1 hands
1 Then
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 rush
1 Two
1 pistol
1 shots
1 were
1 fired
1 and
1 then
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 splash
1 and
1 I
1 knew
1 that
1 the
1 officer
1 on
1 watch
1 was
1 done
1 for
1 Then
1 they
1 burst
1 into
1 the
1 aft
1 cabins
1 There
1 were
1 pistol
1 shots
1 and
1 shouts
1 and
1 for
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 minutes
1 the
1 fight
1 went
1 on
1 Then
1 all
1 was
1 quiet
1 Then
1 they
1 came
1 up
1 on
1 deck
1 again
1 and
1 I
1 heard
1 three
1 splashes
1 that
1 accounted
1 for
1 the
1 captain
1 and
1 the
1 two
1 other
1 mates
1 I
1 thought
1 it
1 safe
1 now
1 to
1 go
1 aft
1 I
1 found
1 that
1 six
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 had
1 been
1 killed
1 These
1 were
1 thrown
1 overboard
1 and
1 then
1 the
1 crew
1 got
1 at
1 the
1 spirit
1 stores
1 and
1 began
1 to
1 drink
1 I
1 looked
1 about
1 for
1 Jans
1 and
1 found
1 him
1 presently
1 sitting
1 on
1 the
1 deck
1 by
1 the
1 bulwark
1 Ah
1 my
1 leetle
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 you
1 have
1 just
1 come
1 in
1 time
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 shot
1 through
1 the
1 body
1 I
1 was
1 not
1 in
1 de
1 fight
1 but
1 was
1 standing
1 near
1 when
1 dey
1 rushed
1 at
1 de
1 officer
1 on
1 watch
1 De
1 first
1 pistol
1 he
1 fire
1 missed
1 de
1 man
1 he
1 aim
1 at
1 and
1 hit
1 me
1 ell
1 it
1 was
1 shust
1 as
1 well
1 I
1 am
1 too
1 old
1 to
1 care
1 for
1 living
1 among
1 de
1 black
1 peoples
1 and
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 want
1 a
1 black
1 wife
1 at
1 all
1 So
1 matters
1 haf
1 not
1 turned
1 out
1 so
1 vera
1 bad
1 Get
1 me
1 some
1 water
1 I
1 got
1 him
1 some
1 but
1 in
1 five
1 minutes
1 the
1 poor
1 old
1 Dutchman
1 was
1 dead
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 one
1 on
1 deck
1 All
1 were
1 shouting
1 and
1 singing
1 in
1 the
1 captain
1 s
1 cabin
1 so
1 I
1 went
1 and
1 turned
1 in
1 forward
1 Morning
1 was
1 just
1 breaking
1 when
1 I
1 suddenly
1 woke
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 great
1 light
1 and
1 running
1 on
1 deck
1 I
1 saw
1 the
1 fire
1 pouring
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 cabin
1 aft
1 I
1 suppose
1 they
1 had
1 all
1 drunk
1 themselves
1 stupid
1 and
1 had
1 upset
1 a
1 light
1 and
1 the
1 fire
1 had
1 spread
1 and
1 suffocated
1 them
1 all
1 Anyhow
1 there
1 were
1 none
1 of
1 them
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 I
1 got
1 hold
1 of
1 a
1 water
1 keg
1 and
1 placed
1 it
1 in
1 a
1 boat
1 which
1 luckily
1 hung
1 out
1 on
1 its
1 davits
1 as
1 Jans
1 had
1 the
1 day
1 before
1 been
1 calking
1 a
1 seam
1 in
1 her
1 side
1 just
1 above
1 the
1 water
1 s
1 edge
1 I
1 made
1 a
1 shift
1 to
1 lower
1 it
1 threw
1 off
1 the
1 falls
1 and
1 getting
1 out
1 the
1 oars
1 rowed
1 off
1 I
1 lay
1 by
1 for
1 some
1 little
1 time
1 but
1 did
1 not
1 see
1 a
1 soul
1 on
1 deck
1 Then
1 as
1 I
1 had
1 nowhere
1 particular
1 to
1 go
1 I
1 lay
1 down
1 and
1 slept
1 On
1 getting
1 up
1 I
1 found
1 that
1 I
1 had
1 drifted
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 miles
1 from
1 the
1 ship
1 which
1 was
1 now
1 a
1 mere
1 smoking
1 shell
1 the
1 greater
1 part
1 being
1 burnt
1 to
1 the
1 ater
1 s
1 edge
1 Two
1 miles
1 to
1 the
1 north
1 lay
1 the
1 land
1 and
1 getting
1 out
1 an
1 oar
1 at
1 the
1 stern
1 I
1 sculled
1 her
1 to
1 shore
1 I
1 suppose
1 I
1 had
1 been
1 seen
1 or
1 that
1 the
1 flames
1 of
1 the
1 ship
1 had
1 called
1 down
1 the
1 people
1 for
1 there
1 they
1 were
1 in
1 the
1 bay
1 and
1 such
1 a
1 lot
1 of
1 creatures
1 I
1 never
1 set
1 eyes
1 on
1 Men
1 and
1 women
1 alike
1 was
1 pretty
1 nigh
1 naked
1 and
1 dirt
1 is
1 no
1 name
1 for
1 them
1 Though
1 I
1 was
1 but
1 a
1 boy
1 I
1 was
1 taller
1 than
1 most
1 They
1 came
1 round
1 me
1 and
1 jabbered
1 and
1 jabbered
1 till
1 I
1 was
1 nigh
1 deafened
1 Over
1 and
1 over
1 again
1 they
1 pointed
1 to
1 the
1 ship
1 I
1 thought
1 they
1 wanted
1 to
1 know
1 whether
1 I
1 belonged
1 to
1 it
1 but
1 it
1 couldn
1 t
1 have
1 been
1 that
1 because
1 when
1 I
1 nodded
1 a
1 lot
1 of
1 em
1 jumped
1 into
1 some
1 canoes
1 which
1 was
1 lying
1 ashore
1 and
1 taking
1 me
1 with
1 them
1 paddled
1 off
1 to
1 the
1 ship
1 I
1 suppose
1 they
1 really
1 wanted
1 to
1 know
1 if
1 they
1 could
1 have
1 what
1 they
1 could
1 find
1 That
1 wasn
1 t
1 much
1 but
1 it
1 seemed
1 a
1 treasure
1 to
1 them
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 lot
1 of
1 burned
1 beams
1 floating
1 about
1 alongside
1 and
1 all
1 of
1 these
1 which
1 had
1 iron
1 or
1 copper
1 bolts
1 or
1 fastenings
1 they
1 took
1 in
1 tow
1 and
1 rowed
1 ashore
1 e
1 hadn
1 t
1 been
1 gone
1 many
1 hundred
1 yards
1 from
1 the
1 vessel
1 when
1 she
1 sunk
1 ell
1 young
1 gentlemen
1 for
1 upwards
1 of
1 two
1 years
1 I
1 lived
1 with
1 them
1 critturs
1 My
1 clothes
1 soon
1 wore
1 out
1 and
1 I
1 got
1 to
1 be
1 as
1 naked
1 and
1 dirty
1 as
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 em
1 They
1 were
1 good
1 hands
1 at
1 fishing
1 and
1 could
1 spear
1 a
1 fish
1 by
1 the
1 light
1 of
1 a
1 torch
1 wonderful
1 In
1 other
1 respects
1 they
1 didn
1 t
1 seem
1 to
1 have
1 much
1 sense
1 They
1 lived
1 when
1 I
1 first
1 went
1 there
1 in
1 holes
1 scratched
1 in
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 a
1 hill
1 but
1 I
1 taught
1 em
1 to
1 make
1 huts
1 making
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 ax
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 iron
1 saved
1 In
1 summer
1 they
1 used
1 to
1 live
1 in
1 these
1 but
1 in
1 winter
1 when
1 it
1 was
1 awful
1 cold
1 we
1 lived
1 in
1 the
1 holes
1 which
1 were
1 a
1 sight
1 warmer
1 than
1 the
1 huts
1 Law
1 what
1 a
1 time
1 that
1 was
1 I
1 had
1 no
1 end
1 of
1 adventures
1 with
1 wild
1 beasts
1 The
1 way
1 the
1 lions
1 used
1 to
1 roar
1 and
1 the
1 elephants
1 -
1 -
1 I
1 think
1 Jack
1 Ruthven
1 interrupted
1 that
1 this
1 must
1 be
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 embellishments
1 which
1 have
1 crept
1 in
1 since
1 you
1 first
1 began
1 telling
1 the
1 tale
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 I
1 should
1 keep
1 it
1 in
1 if
1 I
1 were
1 you
1 because
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 there
1 are
1 neither
1 lions
1 or
1 elephants
1 in
1 South
1 America
1 throws
1 a
1 doubt
1 upon
1 the
1 accuracy
1 of
1 this
1 portion
1 of
1 your
1 story
1 It
1 may
1 be
1 sir
1 the
1 sailor
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 twinkle
1 of
1 his
1 eyes
1 that
1 the
1 elephants
1 and
1 lions
1 may
1 not
1 have
1 been
1 in
1 the
1 first
1 story
1 Now
1 I
1 think
1 of
1 it
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 recall
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 but
1 you
1 see
1 people
1 wants
1 to
1 know
1 all
1 about
1 it
1 They
1 ain
1 t
1 satisfied
1 when
1 I
1 tell
1 em
1 that
1 I
1 lived
1 two
1 years
1 among
1 these
1 chaps
1 They
1 wants
1 to
1 know
1 how
1 I
1 passed
1 my
1 time
1 and
1 whether
1 there
1 were
1 any
1 wild
1 beasts
1 and
1 a
1 lot
1 of
1 such
1 like
1 questions
1 and
1 in
1 course
1 I
1 must
1 answer
1 them
1 So
1 then
1 you
1 see
1 naturally
1 bellishments
1 creeps
1 in
1 but
1 I
1 did
1 live
1 there
1 for
1 two
1 years
1 that
1 s
1 gospel
1 truth
1 and
1 I
1 did
1 go
1 pretty
1 nigh
1 naked
1 and
1 in
1 winter
1 was
1 pretty
1 near
1 starved
1 to
1 death
1 over
1 and
1 over
1 again
1 hen
1 the
1 ground
1 was
1 too
1 hard
1 to
1 dig
1 up
1 roots
1 and
1 the
1 sea
1 was
1 too
1 rough
1 for
1 the
1 canoes
1 to
1 put
1 out
1 it
1 went
1 hard
1 with
1 us
1 and
1 very
1 often
1 we
1 looked
1 more
1 like
1 living
1 skelingtons
1 than
1 human
1 beings
1 Every
1 time
1 a
1 ship
1 came
1 in
1 sight
1 they
1 used
1 to
1 hurry
1 me
1 away
1 into
1 the
1 woods
1 I
1 suppose
1 they
1 found
1 me
1 useful
1 and
1 didn
1 t
1 want
1 to
1 part
1 with
1 me
1 At
1 last
1 I
1 got
1 desperate
1 and
1 made
1 up
1 my
1 mind
1 I
1 d
1 make
1 a
1 bolt
1 whatever
1 came
1 of
1 it
1 They
1 didn
1 t
1 watch
1 me
1 when
1 there
1 were
1 no
1 ships
1 near
1 I
1 suppose
1 they
1 thought
1 there
1 was
1 nowhere
1 for
1 me
1 to
1 run
1 to
1 so
1 one
1 night
1 I
1 steals
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 shore
1 gets
1 into
1 a
1 canoe
1 puts
1 in
1 a
1 lot
1 of
1 roots
1 which
1 I
1 had
1 dug
1 up
1 and
1 hidden
1 away
1 in
1 readiness
1 and
1 so
1 makes
1 off
1 I
1 rowed
1 hard
1 all
1 night
1 for
1 I
1 knew
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 after
1 me
1 when
1 they
1 found
1 I
1 had
1 gone
1 Them
1 straits
1 is
1 sometimes
1 miles
1 and
1 miles
1 across
1 at
1 other
1 times
1 not
1 much
1 more
1 than
1 a
1 ship
1 s
1 length
1 and
1 the
1 tide
1 runs
1 through
1 em
1 like
1 a
1 mill
1 race
1 I
1 had
1 chosen
1 a
1 time
1 when
1 I
1 had
1 the
1 tide
1 with
1 me
1 and
1 soon
1 after
1 morning
1 I
1 came
1 to
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 narrow
1 places
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 to
1 have
1 stopped
1 here
1 because
1 it
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 handy
1 for
1 any
1 ship
1 as
1 passed
1 but
1 the
1 tide
1 run
1 so
1 strong
1 and
1 the
1 rocks
1 were
1 so
1 steep
1 on
1 both
1 sides
1 that
1 I
1 couldn
1 t
1 make
1 a
1 landing
1 Howsomdever
1 directly
1 it
1 widened
1 out
1 I
1 managed
1 to
1 paddle
1 into
1 the
1 back
1 water
1 and
1 landed
1 there
1 ell
1 gents
1 would
1 you
1 believe
1 me
1 if
1 there
1 wasn
1 t
1 two
1 big
1 allygaters
1 sitting
1 there
1 with
1 their
1 mouths
1 open
1 ready
1 to
1 swallow
1 me
1 canoe
1 and
1 all
1 when
1 I
1 came
1 to
1 shore
1 No
1 Jack
1 I
1 m
1 afraid
1 we
1 can
1 t
1 believe
1 that
1 e
1 would
1 if
1 we
1 could
1 you
1 know
1 but
1 alligators
1 are
1 not
1 fond
1 of
1 such
1 cold
1 weather
1 as
1 you
1 d
1 been
1 having
1 nor
1 do
1 they
1 frequent
1 the
1 seashore
1 Ah
1 but
1 this
1 you
1 see
1 was
1 a
1 straits
1 Master
1 Ruthven
1 just
1 a
1 narrow
1 straits
1 and
1 I
1 expect
1 the
1 creatures
1 took
1 it
1 for
1 a
1 river
1 No
1 no
1 Jack
1 we
1 can
1 t
1 swallow
1 the
1 alligators
1 any
1 more
1 than
1 they
1 could
1 swallow
1 you
1 and
1 your
1 canoe
1 ell
1 the
1 sailor
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 sigh
1 I
1 won
1 t
1 say
1 no
1 more
1 about
1 the
1 allygaters
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 rightly
1 recall
1 when
1 they
1 came
1 into
1 the
1 story
1 Howsomdever
1 I
1 landed
1 you
1 can
1 believe
1 that
1 you
1 know
1 Oh
1 yes
1 we
1 can
1 quite
1 believe
1 Jack
1 that
1 if
1 you
1 were
1 there
1 in
1 that
1 canoe
1 in
1 that
1 back
1 water
1 with
1 the
1 land
1 close
1 ahead
1 you
1 did
1 land
1 The
1 sailor
1 looked
1 searchingly
1 at
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 then
1 continued
1 I
1 hauled
1 the
1 canoe
1 up
1 and
1 hid
1 it
1 in
1 some
1 bushes
1 and
1 it
1 were
1 well
1 I
1 did
1 for
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 afterwards
1 a
1 great
1 -
1 -
1 and
1 he
1 paused
1 Does
1 the
1 hippypotybus
1 live
1 in
1 them
1 ere
1 waters
1 young
1 gents
1 He
1 does
1 not
1 Jack
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 Then
1 it
1 s
1 clear
1 the
1 sailor
1 said
1 that
1 it
1 wasn
1 t
1 a
1 hippypotybus
1 It
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 a
1 seal
1 Yes
1 it
1 might
1 have
1 been
1 a
1 seal
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 hat
1 did
1 he
1 do
1 ell
1 he
1 just
1 took
1 a
1 look
1 at
1 me
1 gents
1 winked
1 with
1 one
1 eye
1 as
1 much
1 as
1 to
1 say
1 I
1 see
1 you
1 and
1 went
1 down
1 again
1 There
1 warn
1 t
1 nothing
1 else
1 as
1 he
1 could
1 do
1 was
1 there
1 It
1 was
1 the
1 best
1 thing
1 he
1 could
1 do
1 anyhow
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 ell
1 gents
1 I
1 lived
1 there
1 for
1 about
1 three
1 weeks
1 and
1 then
1 a
1 ship
1 comes
1 along
1 homeward
1 bound
1 and
1 I
1 goes
1 out
1 and
1 hails
1 her
1 At
1 first
1 they
1 thought
1 as
1 I
1 was
1 a
1 native
1 as
1 had
1 learned
1 to
1 speak
1 English
1 and
1 it
1 wasn
1 t
1 till
1 they
1 d
1 boiled
1 me
1 for
1 three
1 hours
1 in
1 the
1 ship
1 s
1 copper
1 as
1 they
1 got
1 at
1 the
1 color
1 of
1 my
1 skin
1 and
1 could
1 believe
1 as
1 I
1 was
1 English
1 So
1 I
1 came
1 back
1 here
1 and
1 found
1 the
1 old
1 woman
1 still
1 alive
1 and
1 took
1 to
1 fishing
1 again
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 weeks
1 and
1 weeks
1 before
1 I
1 could
1 get
1 her
1 or
1 any
1 one
1 else
1 to
1 believe
1 as
1 I
1 was
1 Jack
1 Perkins
1 And
1 that
1 s
1 all
1 the
1 story
1 young
1 gents
1 Generally
1 I
1 tells
1 it
1 a
1 sight
1 longer
1 to
1 the
1 gents
1 as
1 come
1 down
1 from
1 London
1 in
1 summer
1 but
1 you
1 see
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 make
1 much
1 out
1 of
1 it
1 when
1 ye
1 won
1 t
1 let
1 me
1 have
1 bellishments
1 And
1 how
1 much
1 of
1 it
1 is
1 true
1 altogether
1 Jack
1 Frank
1 asked
1 Really
1 how
1 much
1 It
1 s
1 all
1 true
1 as
1 I
1 have
1 told
1 you
1 young
1 masters
1 the
1 boatman
1 said
1 It
1 were
1 every
1 bit
1 true
1 about
1 the
1 running
1 down
1 of
1 the
1 smack
1 and
1 me
1 being
1 nearly
1 killed
1 by
1 the
1 skipper
1 and
1 the

1 and

1 time
1 -
1 -no
1 I
1 won
1 t

1 two
1 years
1 but
1 it
1 might

1 with

1 natives
1 before
1 a

1 CHAPTER
1 IV
1 A
1 RISING
1 TIDE
1 The
1 half
1 year
1 was
1 drawing
1 to
1 its
1 close
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 generally
1 agreed
1 at
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 s
1 that
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 the
1 jolliest
1 ever
1 known
1 The
1 boating
1 episode
1 and
1 that
1 of
1 the
1 tea
1 at
1 Oak
1 Farm
1 had
1 been
1 events
1 which
1 had
1 given
1 a
1 fillip
1 to
1 existence
1 The
1 school
1 had
1 been
1 successful
1 in
1 the
1 greater
1 part
1 of
1 its
1 cricket
1 matches
1 and
1 generally
1 every
1 one
1 was
1 well
1 satisfied
1 with
1 himself
1 On
1 the
1 Saturday
1 preceding
1 the
1 breaking
1 up
1 Frank
1 with
1 Ruthven
1 Charlie
1 Goodall
1 and
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 naturalists
1 started
1 along
1 the
1 seashore
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 anemones
1 and
1 other
1 marine
1 creatures
1 among
1 the
1 rocks
1 and
1 pools
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 South
1 Foreland
1 Between
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 Frank
1 a
1 strong
1 feeling
1 of
1 affection
1 had
1 grown
1 up
1 since
1 the
1 date
1 of
1 their
1 boating
1 adventure
1 They
1 were
1 constantly
1 together
1 now
1 and
1 as
1 Ruthven
1 was
1 also
1 intended
1 for
1 the
1 army
1 and
1 would
1 probably
1 obtain
1 his
1 commission
1 about
1 the
1 same
1 time
1 as
1 Frank
1 they
1 often
1 talked
1 over
1 their
1 future
1 and
1 indulged
1 in
1 hopes
1 that
1 they
1 might
1 often
1 meet
1 and
1 that
1 in
1 their
1 campaigns
1 they
1 might
1 go
1 through
1 adventures
1 together
1 Tide
1 was
1 low
1 when
1 they
1 started
1 They
1 had
1 nearly
1 three
1 miles
1 to
1 walk
1 The
1 pools
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 Deal
1 and
1 almer
1 had
1 often
1 been
1 searched
1 but
1 they
1 hoped
1 that
1 once
1 round
1 the
1 Foreland
1 they
1 might
1 light
1 upon
1 specimens
1 differing
1 from
1 any
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 hitherto
1 found
1 For
1 some
1 hours
1 they
1 searched
1 the
1 pools
1 retiring
1 as
1 the
1 tide
1 advanced
1 Then
1 they
1 went
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 cliffs
1 and
1 sat
1 down
1 to
1 open
1 their
1 cans
1 and
1 compare
1 the
1 treasures
1 they
1 had
1 collected
1 The
1 spot
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 unwittingly
1 selected
1 was
1 a
1 little
1 bay
1 For
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 they
1 sat
1 comparing
1 their
1 specimens
1 Then
1 Frank
1 said
1 Come
1 along
1 it
1 is
1 time
1 to
1 be
1 moving
1 As
1 he
1 rose
1 to
1 his
1 feet
1 he
1 uttered
1 an
1 exclamation
1 of
1 dismay
1 Although
1 the
1 tide
1 was
1 still
1 at
1 some
1 little
1 distance
1 from
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 they
1 were
1 sitting
1 it
1 had
1 already
1 reached
1 the
1 cliffs
1 extending
1 out
1 at
1 either
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 bay
1 A
1 brisk
1 wind
1 was
1 blowing
1 on
1 shore
1 and
1 the
1 waves
1 were
1 already
1 splashing
1 against
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 rocks
1 The
1 whole
1 party
1 leaped
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 and
1 seizing
1 their
1 cans
1 ran
1 off
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 their
1 speed
1 to
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 bay
1 I
1 will
1 see
1 how
1 deep
1 the
1 water
1 is
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 we
1 may
1 yet
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 wade
1 round
1 The
1 water
1 soon
1 reached
1 Frank
1 s
1 waist
1 He
1 waded
1 on
1 until
1 it
1 was
1 up
1 to
1 his
1 shoulders
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 to
1 leap
1 as
1 each
1 wave
1 approached
1 him
1 Then
1 he
1 returned
1 to
1 his
1 friends
1 I
1 could
1 see
1 round
1 he
1 said
1 and
1 I
1 think
1 I
1 could
1 have
1 got
1 round
1 without
1 getting
1 into
1 deeper
1 water
1 The
1 worst
1 of
1 it
1 is
1 the
1 bottom
1 is
1 all
1 rocky
1 and
1 I
1 stumbled
1 several
1 times
1 and
1 should
1 have
1 gone
1 under
1 water
1 if
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 have
1 swam
1 You
1 can
1 t
1 swim
1 Ruthven
1 I
1 know
1 can
1 you
1 other
1 fellows
1 Goodall
1 could
1 swim
1 as
1 could
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 others
1 Now
1 Ruthven
1 Frank
1 said
1 if
1 you
1 will
1 put
1 your
1 hand
1 on
1 my
1 shoulder
1 and
1 keep
1 quiet
1 I
1 think
1 I
1 could
1 carry
1 you
1 around
1 Goodall
1 and
1 Jackson
1 can
1 take
1 Childers
1 But
1 neither
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 boys
1 had
1 much
1 confidence
1 in
1 their
1 swimming
1 They
1 could
1 get
1 thirty
1 or
1 forty
1 yards
1 but
1 felt
1 sure
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 render
1 but
1 little
1 assistance
1 to
1 Childers
1 and
1 in
1 fact
1 scarcely
1 liked
1 to
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 alone
1 For
1 some
1 time
1 they
1 debated
1 the
1 question
1 the
1 sea
1 every
1 minute
1 rising
1 and
1 pushing
1 them
1 farther
1 and
1 farther
1 from
1 the
1 point
1 Look
1 here
1 Frank
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 at
1 last
1 you
1 are
1 not
1 sure
1 you
1 can
1 carry
1 me
1 The
1 others
1 are
1 quite
1 certain
1 that
1 they
1 cannot
1 take
1 Childers
1 e
1 must
1 give
1 up
1 that
1 idea
1 The
1 best
1 thing
1 old
1 boy
1 is
1 for
1 you
1 three
1 who
1 can
1 swim
1 to
1 start
1 together
1 Then
1 if
1 either
1 of
1 the
1 others
1 fail
1 you
1 can
1 help
1 them
1 a
1 bit
1 Childers
1 and
1 I
1 must
1 take
1 our
1 chance
1 here
1 hen
1 you
1 get
1 round
1 you
1 must
1 send
1 a
1 boat
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 possible
1 I
1 certainly
1 shall
1 not
1 desert
1 you
1 Ruthven
1 Frank
1 said
1 You
1 know
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 I
1 do
1 that
1 I
1 m
1 not
1 likely
1 to
1 find
1 a
1 boat
1 on
1 the
1 shore
1 till
1 I
1 get
1 pretty
1 near
1 almer
1 Castle
1 and
1 long
1 before
1 we
1 could
1 get
1 back
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 settled
1 here
1 No
1 no
1 old
1 fellow
1 we
1 will
1 see
1 the
1 matter
1 out
1 together
1 Jackson
1 and
1 Goodall
1 can
1 swim
1 round
1 if
1 they
1 like
1 These
1 lads
1 however
1 would
1 not
1 venture
1 to
1 take
1 the
1 risk
1 alone
1 but
1 said
1 they
1 would
1 go
1 if
1 Frank
1 would
1 go
1 with
1 them
1 Chuck
1 off
1 your
1 boots
1 and
1 coats
1 and
1 waistcoats
1 Frank
1 said
1 suddenly
1 proceeding
1 to
1 strip
1 rapidly
1 to
1 the
1 skin
1 I
1 will
1 take
1 them
1 round
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 come
1 back
1 to
1 you
1 Run
1 round
1 the
1 bay
1 you
1 and
1 Childers
1 and
1 see
1 if
1 you
1 can
1 find
1 any
1 sort
1 of
1 ledge
1 or
1 projection
1 that
1 we
1 can
1 take
1 refuge
1 upon
1 Now
1 then
1 come
1 on
1 you
1 two
1 as
1 quick
1 as
1 you
1 can
1 The
1 sea
1 had
1 already
1 reached
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 feet
1 of
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 cliff
1 all
1 round
1 the
1 bay
1 Now
1 mind
1 Frank
1 said
1 sharply
1 no
1 struggling
1 and
1 nonsense
1 you
1 fellows
1 I
1 will
1 keep
1 quite
1 close
1 to
1 you
1 and
1 stick
1 to
1 you
1 so
1 you
1 needn
1 t
1 be
1 afraid
1 If
1 you
1 get
1 tired
1 just
1 put
1 one
1 hand
1 on
1 my
1 back
1 and
1 swim
1 with
1 the
1 other
1 and
1 your
1 legs
1 and
1 above
1 all
1 things
1 keep
1 your
1 heads
1 as
1 low
1 as
1 possible
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 so
1 as
1 just
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 breathe
1 The
1 three
1 lads
1 soon
1 waded
1 out
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 they
1 could
1 go
1 and
1 then
1 struck
1 out
1 Jackson
1 and
1 Goodall
1 were
1 both
1 poor
1 swimmers
1 and
1 would
1 have
1 fared
1 very
1 badly
1 alone
1 The
1 confidence
1 however
1 which
1 they
1 entertained
1 in
1 Frank
1 gave
1 them
1 courage
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 well
1 abreast
1 of
1 the
1 point
1 when
1 first
1 Jackson
1 and
1 then
1 Goodall
1 put
1 their
1 hands
1 on
1 his
1 shoulders
1 Thanks
1 to
1 the
1 instructions
1 he
1 had
1 given
1 them
1 and
1 to
1 their
1 confidence
1 in
1 him
1 they
1 placed
1 no
1 great
1 weight
1 upon
1 him
1 But
1 every
1 ounce
1 tells
1 heavily
1 on
1 a
1 swimmer
1 and
1 Frank
1 gave
1 a
1 gasp
1 of
1 relief
1 as
1 at
1 last
1 his
1 feet
1 touched
1 the
1 ground
1 Bidding
1 his
1 companions
1 at
1 once
1 set
1 off
1 at
1 a
1 run
1 he
1 sat
1 down
1 for
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 minutes
1 to
1 recover
1 his
1 breath
1 It
1 is
1 lucky
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 himself
1 that
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 try
1 with
1 Ruthven
1 It
1 s
1 a
1 very
1 different
1 thing
1 carrying
1 fellows
1 who
1 can
1 swim
1 and
1 fellows
1 who
1 can
1 t
1 hat
1 fools
1 we
1 ve
1 been
1 to
1 let
1 ourselves
1 he
1 caught
1 here
1 I
1 had
1 no
1 idea
1 the
1 tide
1 came
1 so
1 high
1 or
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 so
1 dangerous
1 and
1 none
1 of
1 us
1 have
1 ever
1 been
1 round
1 here
1 before
1 Now
1 I
1 must
1 go
1 back
1 to
1 Ruthven
1 Frank
1 found
1 it
1 even
1 harder
1 work
1 to
1 get
1 back
1 than
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 to
1 come
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 bay
1 for
1 the
1 tide
1 was
1 against
1 him
1 now
1 At
1 last
1 he
1 stood
1 beside
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 Childers
1 e
1 can
1 only
1 find
1 one
1 place
1 Frank
1 where
1 there
1 is
1 any
1 projection
1 a
1 fellow
1 could
1 stand
1 upon
1 and
1 that
1 is
1 only
1 large
1 enough
1 for
1 one
1 See
1 he
1 said
1 pointing
1 to
1 a
1 projecting
1 block
1 of
1 chalk
1 whose
1 upper
1 surface
1 some
1 eight
1 inches
1 wide
1 was
1 tolerably
1 flat
1 There
1 is
1 a
1 cave
1 here
1 too
1 which
1 may
1 go
1 beyond
1 the
1 tide
1 It
1 is
1 not
1 deep
1 but
1 it
1 slopes
1 up
1 a
1 bit
1 That
1 will
1 never
1 do
1 Frank
1 said
1 as
1 the
1 waves
1 come
1 in
1 they
1 will
1 rush
1 up
1 and
1 fill
1 it
1 to
1 the
1 top
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 see
1 it
1 is
1 all
1 rounded
1 by
1 the
1 water
1 Now
1 Childers
1 we
1 will
1 put
1 you
1 on
1 that
1 stone
1 You
1 will
1 be
1 perfectly
1 safe
1 there
1 for
1 you
1 see
1 it
1 is
1 two
1 feet
1 above
1 this
1 greenish
1 line
1 which
1 shows
1 where
1 the
1 water
1 generally
1 comes
1 to
1 The
1 tides
1 are
1 not
1 at
1 spring
1 at
1 present
1 so
1 though
1 you
1 may
1 get
1 a
1 splashing
1 there
1 is
1 no
1 fear
1 of
1 your
1 being
1 washed
1 off
1 The
1 water
1 was
1 already
1 knee
1 deep
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 rocks
1 and
1 the
1 waves
1 took
1 them
1 nearly
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 shoulders
1 Ruthven
1 did
1 not
1 attempt
1 to
1 dispute
1 Frank
1 s
1 allotment
1 of
1 the
1 one
1 place
1 of
1 safety
1 to

1 Frank
1 and
1 he
1 placed
1 themselves
1 below
1 the
1 block
1 of
1 chalk
1 which
1 was
1 somewhat
1 over
1 six
1 feet
1 from
1 the
1 ground
1 Then
1 Childers
1 scrambled
1 up
1 on
1 to
1 their
1 shoulders
1 and
1 from
1 these
1 stepped
1 onto
1 the
1 ledge
1 I
1 am
1 all
1 right
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 wish
1 to
1 Heaven
1 that
1 you
1 were
1 too
1 e
1 shall
1 do
1 Frank
1 said
1 Mind
1 you
1 hold
1 tight
1 Childers
1 You
1 had
1 better
1 turn
1 round
1 with
1 your
1 face
1 to
1 the
1 cliff
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 grip
1 hold
1 and
1 steady
1 yourself
1 in
1 case
1 the
1 waves
1 come
1 up
1 high
1 The
1 tide
1 will
1 turn
1 in
1 three
1 quarters
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 at
1 the
1 outside
1 Now
1 then
1 Ruthven
1 let
1 s
1 make
1 a
1 fight
1 for
1 it
1 old
1 man
1 hat
1 are
1 you
1 going
1 to
1 do
1 Frank
1 e
1 will
1 wade
1 along
1 here
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 we
1 can
1 towards
1 the
1 corner
1 and
1 than
1 we
1 must
1 swim
1 for
1 it
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 think
1 it
1 s
1 possible
1 to
1 stay
1 here
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 if
1 the
1 tide
1 will
1 turn
1 so
1 soon
1 Quite
1 impossible
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 nearly
1 taken
1 off
1 my
1 feet
1 twice
1 already
1 and
1 the
1 water
1 will
1 rise
1 a
1 yard
1 yet
1 at
1 least
1 e
1 should
1 be
1 smashed
1 against
1 the
1 rocks
1 even
1 if
1 we
1 weren
1 t
1 drowned
1 It
1 must
1 be
1 tried
1 Ruthven
1 There
1 is
1 no
1 other
1 way
1 for
1 it
1 The
1 distance
1 is
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 farther
1 than
1 it
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 if
1 we
1 had
1 started
1 at
1 first
1 but
1 it
1 isn
1 t
1 the
1 distance
1 that
1 makes
1 much
1 matter
1 e
1 ve
1 only
1 got
1 to
1 go
1 out
1 a
1 little
1 way
1 and
1 the
1 tide
1 will
1 soon
1 take
1 us
1 around
1 the
1 point
1 Everything
1 depends
1 on
1 you
1 I
1 can
1 take
1 you
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 and
1 land
1 you
1 safely
1 enough
1 if
1 you
1 will
1 lie
1 quiet
1 If
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 you
1 will
1 drown
1 both
1 of
1 us
1 So
1 it
1 s
1 entirely
1 in
1 your
1 hands
1 Look
1 out
1 At
1 this
1 moment
1 a
1 larger
1 wave
1 than
1 usual
1 took
1 both
1 boys
1 off
1 their
1 legs
1 and
1 dashed
1 them
1 with
1 considerable
1 force
1 against
1 the
1 cliff
1 Frank
1 seized
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 assisted
1 him
1 to
1 regain
1 his
1 feet
1 Now
1 old
1 fellow
1 let
1 me
1 put
1 you
1 on
1 your
1 back
1 I
1 will
1 lie
1 on
1 mine
1 and
1 tow
1 you
1 along
1 Don
1 t
1 struggle
1 don
1 t
1 move
1 above
1 all
1 don
1 t
1 try
1 and
1 lift
1 your
1 head
1 and
1 don
1 t
1 mind
1 if
1 a
1 little
1 water
1 gets
1 in
1 your
1 mouth
1 Now
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 Ruthven
1 felt
1 himself
1 under
1 water
1 and
1 had
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 great
1 effort
1 to
1 restrain
1 himself
1 from
1 struggling
1 to
1 come
1 to
1 the
1 surface
1 Then
1 he
1 felt
1 himself
1 lying
1 on
1 his
1 back
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 supported
1 by
1 Frank
1 The
1 motion
1 was
1 not
1 unpleasant
1 as
1 he
1 rose
1 and
1 fell
1 on
1 the
1 waves
1 although
1 now
1 and
1 then
1 a
1 splash
1 of
1 water
1 came
1 over
1 his
1 face
1 and
1 made
1 him
1 cough
1 and
1 splutter
1 for
1 breath
1 He
1 could
1 see
1 nothing
1 but
1 the
1 blue
1 sky
1 overhead
1 could
1 feel
1 nothing
1 except
1 that
1 occasionally
1 he
1 received
1 a
1 blow
1 from
1 one
1 or
1 other
1 of
1 Frank
1 s
1 knees
1 as
1 the
1 latter
1 swam
1 beneath
1 him
1 with
1 Ruthven
1 s
1 head
1 on
1 his
1 chest
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 dreamy
1 sensation
1 and
1 looking
1 back
1 upon
1 it
1 afterwards
1 Ruthven
1 could
1 never
1 recall
1 anything
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 thought
1 of
1 It
1 seemed
1 simply
1 a
1 drowsy
1 pleasant
1 time
1 except
1 when
1 occasionally
1 a
1 wave
1 covered
1 his
1 face
1 His
1 first
1 sensation
1 was
1 that
1 of
1 surprise
1 when
1 he
1 felt
1 the
1 motion
1 change
1 and
1 Frank
1 lifted
1 his
1 head
1 from
1 the
1 water
1 and
1 said
1 Stand
1 up
1 old
1 fellow
1 Thank
1 God
1 here
1 we
1 are
1 safe
1 Frank
1 had
1 indeed
1 found
1 the
1 journey
1 easier
1 than
1 that
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 before
1 undertaken
1 with
1 the
1 others
1 He
1 had
1 scarcely
1 tried
1 to
1 progress
1 but
1 had
1 after
1 getting
1 sufficiently
1 far
1 out
1 to
1 allow
1 the
1 tide
1 to
1 take
1 him
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 drifted
1 quietly
1 I
1 owe
1 my
1 life
1 to
1 you
1 Frank
1 I
1 shall
1 never
1 forget
1 it
1 old
1 fellow
1 It
1 s
1 been
1 a
1 close
1 thing
1 Frank
1 answered
1 but
1 you
1 owe
1 your
1 life
1 as
1 much
1 to
1 your
1 own
1 coolness
1 as
1 to
1 me
1 and
1 above
1 all
1 Ruthven
1 don
1 t
1 let
1 us
1 forget
1 that
1 we
1 both
1 owe
1 our
1 lives
1 to
1 God
1 I
1 sha
1 n
1 t
1 forget
1 it
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 quietly
1 and
1 they
1 stood
1 for
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 without
1 speaking
1 Now
1 what
1 had
1 we
1 better
1 do
1 Shall
1 we
1 start
1 to
1 run
1 home
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 Frank
1 laughed
1 for
1 he
1 had
1 nothing
1 on
1 but
1 his
1 trousers
1 These
1 he
1 had
1 slipped
1 on
1 after
1 the
1 return
1 from
1 his
1 first
1 trip
1 pushing
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 his
1 things
1 into
1 a
1 crevice
1 in
1 the
1 rocks
1 as
1 high
1 up
1 as
1 he
1 could
1 reach
1 You
1 had
1 better
1 take
1 off
1 your
1 things
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 lay
1 them
1 out
1 to
1 dry
1 in
1 the
1 sun
1 The
1 boat
1 will
1 be
1 here
1 in
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 I
1 wonder
1 how
1 Childers
1 is
1 getting
1 on
1 I
1 think
1 he
1 will
1 be
1 safe
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 The
1 tide
1 will
1 not
1 rise
1 high
1 enough
1 for
1 there
1 to
1 be
1 much
1 danger
1 of
1 his
1 being
1 washed
1 off
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 so
1 either
1 Frank
1 agreed
1 or
1 I
1 would
1 try
1 and
1 swim
1 back
1 again
1 but
1 I
1 really
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 I
1 could
1 get
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 against
1 the
1 tide
1 again
1 In
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 a
1 boat
1 rowing
1 four
1 oars
1 was
1 seen
1 approaching
1 They
1 are
1 laying
1 out
1 well
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 They
1 couldn
1 t
1 row
1 harder
1 if
1 they
1 were
1 rowing
1 a
1 race
1 But
1 had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 for
1 you
1 old
1 fellow
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 too
1 late
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 I
1 am
1 concerned
1 As
1 the
1 boat
1 approached
1 the
1 coxswain
1 waved
1 his
1 hat
1 to
1 the
1 boys
1 Frank
1 motioned
1 with
1 his
1 arm
1 for
1 them
1 to
1 row
1 on
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 The
1 boat
1 swept
1 along
1 at
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 from
1 the
1 shore
1 The
1 boys
1 watched
1 them
1 breathlessly
1 Presently
1 as
1 it
1 reached
1 the
1 point
1 they
1 saw
1 the
1 coxswain
1 stand
1 up
1 and
1 say
1 something
1 to
1 the
1 men
1 who
1 glanced
1 over
1 their
1 shoulders
1 as
1 they
1 rowed
1 Then
1 the
1 coxswain
1 gave
1 a
1 loud
1 shout
1 Hold
1 on
1 e
1 ll
1 be
1 with
1 you
1 directly
1 Thank
1 God
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 Childers
1 is
1 all
1 right
1 It
1 was
1 well
1 however
1 that
1 the
1 boat
1 arrived
1 when
1 it
1 did
1 for
1 Childers
1 was
1 utterly
1 exhausted
1 when
1 it
1 reached
1 him
1 The
1 sea
1 had
1 risen
1 so
1 high
1 that
1 the
1 waves
1 broke
1 against
1 his
1 feet
1 throwing
1 the
1 spray
1 far
1 above
1 his
1 head
1 and
1 often
1 nearly
1 washing
1 him
1 from
1 the
1 ledge
1 on
1 which
1 he
1 stood
1 Had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 indeed
1 for
1 the
1 hold
1 which
1 he
1 obtained
1 of
1 the
1 cliff
1 it
1 would
1 several
1 times
1 have
1 swept
1 him
1 away
1 About
1 eighteen
1 inches
1 above
1 his
1 head
1 he
1 had
1 found
1 a
1 ledge
1 sufficiently
1 wide
1 to
1 give
1 a
1 grip
1 for
1 his
1 hands
1 and
1 hanging
1 by
1 these
1 he
1 managed
1 to
1 retain
1 his
1 place
1 when
1 three
1 times
1 his
1 feet
1 were
1 swept
1 off
1 the
1 rock
1 by
1 the
1 rush
1 of
1 water
1 The
1 tide
1 was
1 just
1 on
1 the
1 turn
1 when
1 the
1 boat
1 arrived
1 and
1 so
1 exhausted
1 was
1 he
1 that
1 he
1 certainly
1 would
1 not
1 have
1 been
1 able
1 to
1 hold
1 out
1 for
1 the
1 half
1 hour
1 s
1 buffeting
1 to
1 which
1 he
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 exposed
1 before
1 the
1 water
1 fell
1 sufficiently
1 to
1 leave
1 him
1 After
1 helping
1 him
1 into
1 the
1 boat
1 the
1 men
1 gathered
1 the
1 clothes
1 jammed
1 in
1 fissures
1 of
1 the
1 cliffs
1 These
1 were
1 of
1 course
1 drenched
1 with
1 water
1 but
1 had
1 for
1 the
1 most
1 part
1 remained
1 firm
1 in
1 their
1 places
1 They
1 now
1 pulled
1 round
1 to
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 Frank
1 and
1 Ruthven
1 were
1 awaiting
1 them
1 Childers
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 pretty
1 nearly
1 done
1 Frank
1 said
1 He
1 must
1 be
1 lying
1 in
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 Childers
1 gave
1 a
1 smile
1 of
1 pleasure
1 as
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 jumped
1 on
1 board
1 He
1 had
1 glancing
1 over
1 his
1 shoulder
1 seen
1 them
1 drift
1 out
1 of
1 sight
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 and
1 had
1 felt
1 certain
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 reached
1 shore
1 It
1 was
1 however
1 a
1 great
1 pleasure
1 to
1 be
1 assured
1 of
1 the
1 fact
1 You
1 have
1 made
1 quite
1 a
1 stir
1 upon
1 the
1 beach
1 young
1 gentlemen
1 the
1 coxswain
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 said
1 hen
1 they
1 two
1 came
1 running
1 up
1 without
1 their
1 shoes
1 or
1 coats
1 and
1 said
1 there
1 were
1 three
1 of
1 you
1 cut
1 off
1 in
1 the
1 bay
1 under
1 the
1 Foreland
1 there
1 didn
1 t
1 seem
1 much
1 chance
1 for
1 you
1 It
1 didn
1 t
1 take
1 us
1 two
1 minutes
1 to
1 launch
1 the
1 boat
1 for
1 there
1 were
1 a
1 score
1 of
1 hands
1 helping
1 to
1 run
1 her
1 down
1 and
1 my
1 mates
1 bent
1 to
1 it
1 well
1 I
1 can
1 tell
1 you
1 though
1 we
1 didn
1 t
1 think
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 of
1 any
1 use
1 e
1 were
1 glad
1 when
1 we
1 made
1 you
1 two
1 out
1 on
1 this
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 point
1 Look
1 there
1 s
1 half
1 Deal
1 and
1 almer
1 coming
1 along
1 the
1 shore
1 It
1 was
1 as
1 the
1 boatman
1 said
1 Numbers
1 of
1 persons
1 were
1 streaming
1 along
1 the
1 beach
1 and
1 loud
1 were
1 the
1 cheers
1 which
1 rose
1 as
1 the
1 coxswain
1 stood
1 up
1 and
1 shouted
1 in
1 a
1 stentorian
1 voice
1 All
1 saved
1 Frank
1 put
1 on
1 his
1 things
1 as
1 they
1 approached
1 almer
1 His
1 shoes
1 were
1 lost
1 as
1 were
1 those
1 of
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 difficulty
1 in
1 getting
1 his
1 arms
1 into
1 his
1 wet
1 and
1 shrunken
1 jacket
1 Quite
1 a
1 crowd
1 were
1 gathered
1 near
1 the
1 castle
1 as
1 the
1 boat
1 rowed
1 to
1 shore
1 and
1 a
1 hearty
1 cheer
1 arose
1 as
1 it
1 was
1 run
1 up
1 on
1 the
1 shingle
1 and
1 the
1 boys
1 were
1 helped
1 out
1 Frank
1 and
1 Ruthven
1 indeed
1 required
1 no
1 assistance
1 They
1 were
1 in
1 no
1 way
1 the
1 worse
1 for
1 the
1 adventure
1 but
1 Childers
1 was
1 so
1 weak
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 unable
1 to
1 stand
1 He
1 was
1 carried
1 up
1 and
1 laid
1 on
1 a
1 fly
1 the
1 others
1 sitting
1 opposite
1 the
1 driver
1 having
1 first
1 taken
1 the
1 precaution
1 of
1 removing
1 the
1 cushions
1 There
1 were
1 among

1 crowd
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 boys
1 from

1 Goodall
1 and

1 had
1 arrived
1 nearly
1 an
1 hour
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 before
1 and
1 the
1 news
1 had
1 spread
1 like
1 wildfire
1 Bats
1 and
1 balls
1 had
1 been
1 thrown
1 down
1 and

1 one
1 had

1 and
1 his
1 companion
1 had
1 already
1 related
1 the
1 circumstance
1 of
1 their
1 being
1 cut
1 off
1 by
1 the
1 water
1 and
1 taken
1 round
1 the
1 point
1 by
1 Frank
1 and
1 as
1 Ruthven
1 on
1 jumping
1 out
1 had
1 explained
1 to
1 his
1 comrades
1 who
1 flocked
1 round
1 to
1 shake
1 his
1 hand
1 I
1 owe
1 my
1 life
1 to
1 Hargate
1 the
1 enthusiasm
1 reached
1 boiling
1 point
1 and
1 Frank
1 had
1 difficulty
1 in
1 taking
1 his
1 place
1 in
1 the
1 fly
1 so
1 anxious
1 were
1 all
1 to
1 shake
1 his
1 hand
1 and
1 pat
1 him
1 on
1 the
1 shoulder
1 Had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 for
1 his
1 anxiety
1 to
1 get
1 home
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 possible
1 and
1 his
1 urgent
1 entreaties
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 carried
1 him
1 on
1 their
1 shoulders
1 in
1 triumph
1 through
1 the
1 town
1 They
1 drove
1 first
1 to
1 the
1 school
1 where
1 Childers
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 carried
1 up
1 to
1 a
1 bed
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 prepared
1 with
1 warm
1 blankets
1 in
1 readiness
1 Ruthven
1 needed
1 only
1 to
1 change
1 his
1 clothes
1 The
1 moment
1 they
1 had
1 left
1 the
1 fly
1 Frank
1 drove
1 straight
1 home
1 and
1 was
1 delighted
1 at
1 finding
1 from
1 his
1 mother
1 s
1 exclamation
1 of
1 surprise
1 as
1 he
1 alighted
1 from
1 the
1 cab
1 that
1 she
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 suffering
1 any
1 anxiety
1 no
1 one
1 in
1 the
1 general
1 excitement
1 having
1 thought
1 of
1 taking
1 the
1 news
1 to
1 her
1 In
1 answer
1 to
1 her
1 anxious
1 inquiries
1 he
1 made
1 light
1 of
1 the
1 affair
1 saying
1 only
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 stupidly
1 allowed
1 themselves
1 to
1 be
1 cut
1 off
1 by
1 the
1 sea
1 and
1 had
1 got
1 a
1 ducking
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 indeed
1 till
1 the
1 next
1 morning
1 when
1 the
1 other
1 four
1 boys
1 came
1 around
1 to
1 tell
1 Mrs
1 Hargate
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 indebted
1 to
1 Frank
1 for
1 their
1 lives
1 that
1 she
1 had
1 any
1 notion
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 in
1 danger
1 Frank
1 was
1 quite
1 oppressed
1 by
1 what
1 he
1 called
1 the
1 fuss
1 which
1 was
1 made
1 over
1 the
1 affair
1 A
1 thrilling
1 description
1 of
1 it
1 appeared
1 in
1 the
1 local
1 papers
1 A
1 subscription
1 was
1 got
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 school
1 and
1 a
1 gold
1 watch
1 with
1 an
1 inscription
1 was
1 presented
1 to
1 him
1 and
1 he
1 received
1 letters
1 of
1 heart
1 felt
1 thanks
1 from
1 the
1 parents
1 of
1 his
1 four
1 schoolfellows
1 for
1 Childers
1 maintained
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 entirely
1 to
1 Frank
1 s
1 coolness
1 and
1 thoughtfulness
1 that
1 his
1 preservation
1 was
1 also
1 due
1 On
1 the
1 following
1 ednesday
1 the
1 school
1 broke
1 up
1 Frank
1 had
1 several
1 invitations
1 from
1 the
1 boys
1 to
1 spend
1 his
1 holidays
1 with
1 them
1 but
1 he
1 knew
1 how
1 lonely
1 his
1 mother
1 would
1 feel
1 in
1 his
1 absence
1 and
1 he
1 declined
1 all
1 the
1 invitations
1 Mrs
1 Hargate
1 was
1 far
1 from
1 strong
1 and
1 had
1 had
1 several
1 fits
1 of
1 fainting
1 These
1 however
1 had
1 taken
1 place
1 at
1 times
1 when
1 Frank
1 was
1 at
1 school
1 and
1 she
1 had
1 strictly
1 charged
1 her
1 little
1 servant
1 to
1 say
1 nothing
1 about
1 it
1 One
1 day
1 on
1 returning
1 from
1 a
1 long
1 walk
1 he
1 saw
1 the
1 doctor
1 s
1 carriage
1 standing
1 at
1 the
1 door
1 Just
1 as
1 he
1 arrived
1 the
1 door
1 opened
1 and
1 the
1 doctor
1 came
1 out
1 Upon
1 seeing
1 Frank
1 he
1 turned
1 Come
1 in
1 here
1 my
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 Frank
1 followed
1 him
1 and
1 seeing
1 that
1 the
1 blinds
1 were
1 down
1 went
1 to
1 draw
1 them
1 up
1 The
1 doctor
1 laid
1 his
1 hand
1 on
1 his
1 arm
1 Never
1 mind
1 that
1 he
1 said
1 gently
1 My
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 do
1 you
1 know
1 that
1 your
1 mother
1 has
1 been
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 ailing
1 No
1 indeed
1 Frank
1 said
1 with
1 a
1 gasp
1 of
1 pain
1 and
1 surprise
1 It
1 is
1 so
1 my
1 boy
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 attending
1 her
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 She
1 has
1 been
1 suffering
1 from
1 fainting
1 fits
1 brought
1 on
1 by
1 weakness
1 of
1 the
1 heart
1 s
1 action
1 Two
1 hours
1 since
1 I
1 was
1 sent
1 for
1 and
1 found
1 her
1 unconscious
1 My
1 poor
1 boy
1 you
1 must
1 compose
1 yourself
1 God
1 is
1 good
1 and
1 merciful
1 though
1 his
1 decrees
1 are
1 hard
1 to
1 bear
1 Your
1 mother
1 passed
1 away
1 quietly
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 since
1 without
1 recovering
1 consciousness
1 Frank
1 gave
1 a
1 short
1 cry
1 and
1 then
1 sat
1 stunned
1 by
1 the
1 suddenness
1 of
1 the
1 blow
1 The
1 doctor
1 drew
1 out
1 a
1 small
1 case
1 from
1 his
1 pocket
1 and
1 poured
1 a
1 few
1 drops
1 from
1 the
1 phial
1 into
1 a
1 glass
1 added
1 some
1 water
1 and
1 held
1 it
1 to
1 Frank
1 s
1 lips
1 Drink
1 this
1 my
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 Frank
1 turned
1 his
1 head
1 from
1 the
1 offered
1 glass
1 He
1 could
1 not
1 speak
1 Drink
1 this
1 my
1 boy
1 the
1 doctor
1 said
1 again
1 it
1 will
1 do
1 you
1 good
1 Try
1 and
1 be
1 strong
1 for
1 the
1 sake
1 of
1 your
1 little
1 sister
1 who
1 has
1 only
1 you
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 now
1 The
1 thought
1 of
1 Lucy
1 touched
1 the
1 right
1 chord
1 in
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 heart
1 and
1 he
1 burst
1 into
1 a
1 passionate
1 fit
1 of
1 crying
1 The
1 doctor
1 allowed
1 his
1 tears
1 to
1 flow
1 unchecked
1 You
1 will
1 be
1 better
1 now
1 he
1 said
1 presently
1 Now
1 drink
1 this
1 then
1 lie
1 down
1 on
1 the
1 sofa
1 e
1 must
1 not
1 be
1 having
1 you
1 ill
1 you
1 know
1 Frank
1 gulped
1 down
1 the
1 contents
1 of
1 the
1 glass
1 and
1 passive
1 as
1 a
1 child
1 allowed
1 the
1 doctor
1 to
1 place
1 him
1 upon
1 the
1 sofa
1 God
1 help
1 and
1 strengthen
1 you
1 my
1 poor
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 ask
1 help
1 from
1 Him
1 For
1 an
1 hour
1 Frank
1 lay
1 sobbing
1 on
1 the
1 sofa
1 and
1 then
1 remembering
1 the
1 doctor
1 s
1 last
1 words
1 he
1 knelt
1 beside
1 it
1 and
1 prayed
1 for
1 strength
1 A
1 week
1 had
1 passed
1 The
1 blinds
1 were
1 up
1 again
1 Mrs
1 Hargate
1 had
1 been
1 laid
1 in
1 her
1 last
1 home
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 sitting
1 alone
1 again
1 in
1 the
1 little
1 parlor
1 thinking
1 over
1 what
1 had
1 best
1 be
1 done
1 The
1 outlook
1 was
1 a
1 dark
1 one
1 enough
1 to
1 shake
1 the
1 courage
1 of
1 one
1 much
1 older
1 than
1 Frank
1 His
1 mother
1 s
1 pension
1 he
1 knew
1 died
1 with
1 her
1 He
1 had
1 on
1 the
1 doctor
1 s
1 advice
1 written
1 to
1 the
1 ar
1 Office
1 on
1 the
1 day
1 following
1 his
1 mother
1 s
1 death
1 to
1 inform
1 the
1 authorities
1 of
1 the
1 circumstances
1 and
1 to
1 ask
1 if
1 any
1 pension
1 could
1 be
1 granted
1 to
1 his
1 sister
1 The
1 reply
1 had
1 arrived
1 that
1 morning
1 and
1 had
1 relieved
1 him
1 of
1 the
1 greatest
1 of
1 his
1 cares
1 It
1 stated
1 that
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 now
1 just
1 fifteen
1 years
1 old
1 he
1 was
1 not
1 eligible
1 for
1 a
1 pension
1 but
1 that
1 twenty
1 -five
1 pounds
1 a
1 year
1 would
1 be
1 paid
1 to
1 his
1 sister
1 until
1 she
1 married
1 or
1 attained
1 the
1 age
1 of
1 twenty
1 -one
1 He
1 had
1 spoken
1 to
1 the
1 doctor
1 that
1 morning
1 and
1 the
1 latter
1 said
1 that
1 he
1 knew
1 a
1 lady
1 who
1 kept
1 a
1 small
1 school
1 and
1 who
1 would
1 he
1 doubted
1 not
1 be
1 willing
1 to
1 receive
1 Lucy
1 and
1 to
1 board
1 and
1 clothe
1 her
1 for
1 that
1 sum
1 She
1 was
1 a
1 very
1 kind
1 and
1 motherly
1 person
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 sure
1 that
1 Lucy
1 would
1 be
1 most
1 kindly
1 treated
1 and
1 cared
1 for
1 by
1 her
1 It
1 was
1 then
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 future
1 only
1 that
1 Frank
1 had
1 to
1 think
1 There
1 were
1 but
1 a
1 few
1 pounds
1 in
1 the
1 house
1 but
1 the
1 letter
1 from
1 the
1 ar
1 Office
1 inclosed
1 a
1 check
1 for
1 twenty
1 pounds
1 as
1 his
1 mother
1 s
1 quarterly
1 pension
1 was
1 just
1 due
1 The
1 furniture
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 house
1 would
1 fetch
1 but
1 a
1 small
1 sum
1 not
1 more
1 Frank
1 thought
1 than
1 thirty
1 or
1 forty
1 pounds
1 There
1 were
1 a
1 few
1 debts
1 to
1 pay
1 and
1 after
1 all
1 was
1 settled
1 up
1 there
1 would
1 remain
1 about
1 fifty
1 pounds
1 Of
1 this
1 he
1 determined
1 to
1 place
1 half
1 in
1 the
1 doctor
1 s
1 hands
1 for
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 Lucy
1 She
1 will
1 want
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 himself
1 a
1 little
1 pocket
1 money
1 It
1 is
1 hard
1 on
1 a
1 girl
1 having
1 no
1 money
1 to
1 spend
1 of
1 her
1 own
1 Then
1 as
1 she
1 gets
1 on
1 she
1 may
1 need
1 lessons
1 in
1 something
1 or
1 other
1 Besides
1 half
1 the
1 money
1 rightly
1 belongs
1 to
1 her

1 question
1 is

1 ALONE

1 to
1 do
1 A
1 difficult
1 question
1 indeed
1 for
1 a
1 boy
1 of
1 fifteen
1 with
1 but
1 twenty
1 -five
1 pounds
1 and
1 without
1 a
1 friend
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 as
1 he
1 indeed
1 without
1 a
1 friend
1 he
1 asked
1 himself
1 There
1 was
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 Should
1 he
1 apply
1 to
1 him
1 But
1 the
1 doctor
1 had
1 started
1 for
1 a
1 trip
1 on
1 the
1 Continent
1 the
1 day
1 after
1 the
1 school
1 had
1 broken
1 up
1 and
1 would
1 not
1 return
1 for
1 six
1 weeks
1 It
1 was
1 possible
1 that
1 had
1 he
1 been
1 at
1 home
1 he
1 might
1 have
1 offered
1 to
1 keep
1 Frank
1 for
1 a
1 while
1 but
1 the
1 boys
1 seldom
1 stayed
1 at
1 his
1 school
1 past
1 the
1 age
1 of
1 fifteen
1 going
1 elsewhere
1 to
1 have
1 their
1 education
1 completed
1 hat
1 possible
1 claim
1 had
1 he
1 to

1 upon
1 the
1 doctor
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 four
1 years
1 even
1 were
1 the
1 offer
1 made
1 No
1 Frank
1 felt
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 live
1 upon
1 the
1 doctor
1 s
1 charity
1 Then
1 there
1 were
1 the
1 parents
1 of
1 the
1 boys
1 he
1 had
1 saved
1 from
1 drowning
1 But
1 even
1 as
1 he
1 sat
1 alone
1 Frank
1 s
1 face
1 flushed
1 at
1 the
1 thought
1 of
1 trading
1 upon
1 services
1 so
1 rendered
1 The
1 boy
1 s
1 chief
1 fault
1 was
1 pride
1 It
1 was
1 no
1 petty
1 feeling
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 felt
1 no
1 shame
1 at
1 being
1 poorer
1 than
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 It
1 was
1 rather
1 a
1 pride
1 which
1 led
1 him
1 unduly
1 to
1 rely
1 upon
1 himself
1 and
1 to
1 shrink
1 from
1 accepting
1 favors
1 from
1 any
1 one
1 Frank
1 might
1 well
1 without
1 any
1 derogation
1 have
1 written
1 to
1 his
1 friends
1 telling
1 them
1 of
1 the
1 loss
1 he
1 had
1 suffered
1 and
1 the
1 necessity
1 there
1 was
1 for
1 him
1 to
1 earn
1 his
1 living
1 and
1 asking
1 them
1 to
1 beg
1 their
1 fathers
1 to
1 use
1 their
1 interest
1 to
1 procure
1 him
1 a
1 situation
1 as
1 a
1 boy
1 clerk
1 or
1 any
1 other
1 position
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 could
1 earn
1 his
1 livelihood
1 Frank
1 however
1 shrunk
1 from
1 making
1 any
1 such
1 appeal
1 and
1 determined
1 to
1 fight
1 his
1 battle
1 without
1 asking
1 for
1 help
1 He
1 knew
1 nothing
1 of
1 his
1 parents
1 relations
1 His
1 father
1 was
1 an
1 only
1 son
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 left
1 early
1 an
1 orphan
1 His
1 mother
1 too
1 had
1 he
1 was
1 aware
1 lost
1 both
1 her
1 parents
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 never
1 heard
1 her
1 speak
1 of
1 other
1 relations
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 one
1 therefore
1 so
1 far
1 as
1 he
1 knew
1 to
1 whom
1 he
1 could
1 appeal
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 of
1 ties
1 of
1 blood
1 It
1 must
1 be
1 said
1 for
1 him
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 no
1 idea
1 how
1 hard
1 was
1 the
1 task
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 undertaking
1 It
1 seemed
1 to
1 him
1 that
1 it
1 must
1 be
1 easy
1 for
1 a
1 strong
1 active
1 lad
1 to
1 find
1 employment
1 of
1 some
1 sort
1 in
1 London
1 hat
1 the
1 employment
1 might
1 be
1 he
1 cared
1 little
1 for
1 He
1 had
1 no
1 pride
1 of
1 that
1 kind
1 and
1 so
1 that
1 he
1 could
1 earn
1 his
1 bread
1 he
1 cared
1 not
1 much
1 in

1 Already

1 of
1 the
1 furniture
1 which
1 was
1 to
1 take
1 place
1 next
1 day
1 Everything
1 was
1 to
1 be
1 sold
1 except
1 the
1 scientific
1 books
1 which
1 had
1 belonged
1 to
1 his
1 father
1 These
1 had
1 been
1 packed
1 in
1 a
1 great
1 box
1 until
1 the
1 time
1 when
1 he
1 might
1 place
1 them
1 in
1 a
1 library
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 and
1 the
1 doctor
1 kindly
1 offered
1 to
1 keep
1 it
1 for
1 him
1 until
1 such
1 time
1 should
1 arrive
1 Frank
1 wrote
1 a
1 long
1 letter
1 to
1 Ruthven
1 telling
1 him
1 of
1 his
1 loss
1 and
1 his
1 reasons
1 for
1 leaving
1 Deal
1 and
1 promising
1 to
1 write
1 some
1 day
1 and
1 tell
1 him
1 how
1 he
1 was
1 getting
1 on
1 in
1 London
1 This
1 letter
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 intend
1 to
1 post
1 until
1 the
1 last
1 thing
1 before
1 leaving
1 Deal
1 Lucy
1 had
1 already
1 gone
1 to
1 her
1 new
1 home
1 and
1 Frank
1 felt
1 confident
1 that
1 she
1 would
1 be
1 happy
1 there
1 His
1 friend
1 the
1 doctor
1 who
1 had
1 tried
1 strongly
1 but
1 without
1 avail
1 to
1 dissuade
1 Frank
1 from
1 going
1 up
1 to
1 London
1 to
1 seek
1 his
1 fortune
1 there
1 had
1 promised
1 that
1 if
1 the
1 lad
1 referred
1 any
1 inquiries
1 to
1 him
1 he
1 would
1 answer
1 for
1 his
1 character
1 He
1 went
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 beach
1 the
1 last
1 evening
1 and
1 said
1 goodbye
1 to
1 his
1 friends
1 among
1 the
1 fishermen
1 and
1 he
1 walked
1 over
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 and
1 took
1 his
1 last
1 meal
1 with
1 Farmer
1 Gregson
1 Look
1 ye
1 here
1 my
1 lad
1 the
1 farmer
1 said
1 as
1 they
1 parted
1 I
1 tell
1 ye
1 from
1 what
1 I
1 ve
1 heerd
1 this
1 London
1 be
1 a
1 hard
1 nut
1 to
1 crack
1 There
1 be
1 plenty
1 of
1 kernel
1 no
1 doubt
1 when
1 you
1 can
1 get
1 at
1 it
1 but
1 it
1 be
1 hard
1 work
1 to
1 open
1 the

1 Now
1 if

1 Quite
1 the

1 It
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 real
1 pleasure
1 to
1 me
1 to
1 lend
1 you
1 a
1 helping
1 hand
1 Two
1 days
1 after
1 the
1 sale
1 Frank
1 started
1 for
1 London
1 On
1 getting
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 train
1 he
1 felt
1 strange
1 and
1 lonely
1 amid
1 the
1 bustle
1 and
1 confusion
1 which
1 was
1 going
1 on
1 on
1 the
1 platform
1 The
1 doctor
1 had
1 advised
1 him
1 to
1 ask
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 porters
1 or
1 a
1 policeman
1 if
1 he
1 could
1 recommend
1 him
1 to
1 a
1 quiet
1 and
1 respectable
1 lodging
1 as
1 expenses
1 at
1 an
1 hotel
1 would
1 soon
1 make
1 a
1 deep
1 hole
1 in
1 his
1 money
1 He
1 therefore
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 the
1 crowd
1 cleared
1 away
1 addressed
1 himself
1 to
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 porters
1 hat
1 sort
1 of
1 lodgings
1 do
1 you
1 want
1 sir
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 looking
1 at
1 him
1 rather
1 suspiciously
1 with
1 as
1 Frank
1 saw
1 a
1 strong
1 idea
1 in
1 his
1 mind
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 a
1 runaway
1 schoolboy
1 I
1 only
1 want
1 one
1 room
1 he
1 said
1 and
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 care
1 how
1 small
1 it
1 is
1 so
1 that
1 it
1 is
1 clean
1 and
1 quiet
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 out
1 all
1 day
1 and
1 should
1 not
1 give
1 much
1 trouble
1 The
1 porter
1 went
1 away
1 and
1 spoke
1 to
1 some
1 of
1 his
1 mates
1 and
1 presently
1 returned
1 with
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 You
1 re
1 wanting
1 a
1 room
1 I
1 hear
1 sir
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 little
1 house
1 down
1 the
1 Old
1 Kent
1 Road
1 and
1 my
1 missus
1 lets
1 a
1 room
1 or
1 two
1 It
1 s
1 quiet
1 and
1 clean
1 I
1 ll
1 warrant
1 you
1 e
1 have
1 one
1 room
1 vacant
1 at
1 present
1 I
1 m
1 sure
1 that
1 would
1 suit
1 me
1 very
1 well
1 Frank
1 said
1 How
1 much
1 do
1 you
1 charge
1 a
1 week
1 Three
1 and
1 sixpence
1 sir
1 if
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 want
1 any
1 cooking
1 done
1 Frank
1 took
1 the
1 address
1 and
1 leaving
1 his
1 portmanteau
1 in
1 charge
1 of
1 the
1 porter
1 who
1 promised
1 unless
1 he
1 heard
1 to
1 the
1 contrary
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 bring
1 it
1 home
1 with
1 him
1 when
1 he
1 had
1 done
1 his
1 work
1 he
1 set
1 off
1 from
1 the
1 station
1 Deal
1 is
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 quietest
1 and
1 most
1 dreary
1 places
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 of
1 England
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 perfectly
1 astounded
1 at
1 the
1 crowd
1 and
1 bustle
1 which
1 filled
1 the
1 street
1 when
1 he
1 issued
1 from
1 the
1 railway
1 approach
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 London
1 Bridge
1 The
1 porter
1 had
1 told
1 him
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 to
1 turn
1 to
1 his
1 left
1 and
1 keep
1 straight
1 along
1 until
1 he
1 reached
1 the
1 Elephant
1 and
1 Castle
1 He
1 had
1 therefore
1 no
1 trouble
1 about
1 his
1 road
1 and
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 give
1 his
1 whole
1 attention
1 to
1 the
1 sights
1 which
1 met
1 his
1 eye
1 For
1 a
1 time
1 the
1 stream
1 of
1 omnibuses
1 cabs
1 heavy
1 wagons
1 and
1 light
1 carts
1 completely
1 bewildered
1 him
1 as
1 did
1 the
1 throng
1 of
1 people
1 who
1 hastened
1 along
1 the
1 footway
1 He
1 was
1 depressed
1 rather
1 than
1 exhilarated
1 at
1 the
1 sight
1 of
1 this
1 busy
1 multitude
1 He
1 seemed
1 such
1 a
1 solitary
1 atom
1 in
1 the
1 midst
1 of
1 this
1 great
1 moving
1 crowd
1 Presently
1 however
1 the
1 thought
1 that
1 where
1 so
1 many
1 millions
1 gained
1 their
1 living
1 there
1 must
1 be
1 room
1 for
1 one
1 boy
1 more
1 somewhat
1 cheered
1 him
1 He
1 was
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 making
1 his
1 way
1 to
1 his
1 place
1 of
1 destination
1 for
1 he
1 stared
1 into
1 every
1 shop
1 window
1 and
1 being
1 although
1 he
1 was
1 perfectly
1 ignorant
1 of
1 the
1 fact
1 on
1 the
1 wrong
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 pavement
1 he
1 was
1 bumped
1 and
1 bustled
1 continually
1 and
1 was
1 not
1 long
1 in
1 arriving
1 at
1 the
1 conclusion
1 that
1 the
1 people
1 of
1 London
1 must
1 be
1 the
1 roughest
1 and
1 rudest
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 until
1 he
1 ran
1 against
1 a
1 gentleman
1 and
1 was
1 greeted
1 with
1 the
1 angry
1 now
1 then
1 boy
1 here
1 are
1 you
1 going
1 hy
1 the
1 deuce
1 don
1 t
1 you
1 keep
1 on
1 your
1 own
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 pavement
1 that
1 he
1 perceived
1 that
1 the
1 moving
1 throng
1 was
1 divided
1 into
1 two
1 currents
1 that
1 on
1 the
1 inside
1 meeting
1 him
1 while
1 the
1 outside
1 stream
1 was
1 proceeding
1 in
1 the
1 same
1 direction
1 as
1 himself
1 After
1 this
1 he
1 got
1 on
1 better
1 and
1 arrived
1 without
1 adventure
1 at
1 the
1 house
1 of
1 the
1 porter
1 in
1 the
1 Old
1 Kent
1 Road
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 small
1 house
1 but
1 was
1 clean
1 and
1 respectable
1 and
1 Frank
1 found
1 that
1 the
1 room
1 would
1 suit
1 him
1 well
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 wait
1 upon
1 the
1 lodgers
1 the
1 landlady
1 said
1 except
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 beds
1 and
1 tidy
1 the
1 rooms
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 So
1 if
1 you
1 want
1 breakfast
1 and
1 tea
1 at
1 home
1 you
1 will
1 have
1 to
1 get
1 them
1 yourself
1 There
1 is
1 a
1 separate
1 place
1 downstairs
1 for
1 your
1 coals
1 There
1 are
1 some
1 tea
1 things
1 plates
1 and
1 dishes
1 in
1 this
1 cupboard
1 You
1 will
1 want
1 to
1 buy
1 a
1 small
1 tea
1 kettle
1 and
1 a
1 gridiron
1 and
1 a
1 frying
1 pan
1 in
1 case
1 you
1 want
1 a
1 chop
1 or
1 a
1 rasher
1 Do
1 you
1 think
1 you
1 can
1 cook
1 them
1 yourself
1 Frank
1 amused
1 at
1 the
1 thought
1 of
1 cooking
1 and
1 catering
1 for
1 himself
1 said
1 boldly
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 soon
1 learn
1 You
1 are
1 a
1 very
1 young
1 gentleman
1 the
1 landlady
1 said
1 eyeing
1 him
1 doubtfully
1 to
1 be
1 setting
1 up
1 on
1 your
1 own
1 hook
1 I
1 mean
1 she
1 said
1 seeing
1 Frank
1 look
1 puzzled
1 setting
1 up
1 housekeeping
1 on
1 your
1 own
1 account
1 You
1 will
1 have
1 to
1 be
1 particular
1 careful
1 with
1 the
1 frying
1 pan
1 because
1 if
1 you
1 were
1 to
1 upset
1 the
1 fat
1 in
1 the
1 fire
1 you
1 might
1 have
1 the
1 house
1 in
1 a
1 blaze
1 in
1 a
1 jiffey
1 Frank
1 said
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 certainly
1 be
1 careful
1 with
1 the
1 frying
1 pan
1 ell
1 she
1 went
1 on
1 as
1 you
1 re
1 a
1 stranger
1 to
1 the
1 place
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 as
1 you
1 could
1 do
1 better
1 than
1 get
1 your
1 tea
1 and
1 sugar
1 and
1 things
1 at
1 the
1 grocer
1 s
1 at
1 the
1 next
1 corner
1 I
1 deals
1 there
1 myself
1 and
1 he
1 gives
1 every
1 satisfaction
1 My
1 baker
1 will
1 be
1 round
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 and
1 if
1 you
1 likes
1 I
1 can
1 take
1 in
1 your
1 bread
1 for
1 you
1 The
1 same
1 with
1 milk
1 These
1 matters
1 being
1 arranged
1 and
1 Frank
1 agreeing
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 the
1 proposition
1 that
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 a
1 stranger
1 it
1 would
1 make
1 things
1 more
1 comfortable
1 were
1 he
1 to
1 pay
1 his
1 rent
1 in
1 advance
1 found
1 himself
1 alone
1 in
1 his
1 new
1 apartment
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 room
1 about
1 ten
1 feet
1 square
1 The
1 bed
1 occupied
1 one
1 corner
1 with
1 the
1 washstand
1 at
1 its
1 foot
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 small
1 table
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 the
1 fireplace
1 and
1 two
1 chairs
1 a
1 piece
1 of
1 carpet
1 half
1 covered
1 the
1 floor
1 and
1 these
1 with
1 the
1 addition
1 of
1 the
1 articles
1 in
1 the
1 cupboard
1 constituted
1 the
1 furniture
1 of
1 the
1 room
1 Feeling
1 hungry
1 after
1 his
1 journey
1 Frank
1 resolved
1 to
1 go
1 out
1 at
1 once
1 and
1 get
1 something
1 to
1 eat
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 lay
1 in
1 a
1 stock
1 of
1 provisions
1 After
1 some
1 hesitation
1 regarding
1 the
1 character
1 of
1 the
1 meal
1 he
1 decided
1 upon
1 two
1 Bath
1 buns
1 determining
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 substantial
1 tea
1 He
1 laid
1 in
1 a
1 supply
1 of
1 tea
1 sugar
1 butter
1 and
1 salt
1 bought
1 a
1 little
1 kettle
1 a
1 frying
1 pan
1 and
1 a
1 gridiron
1 Then
1 he
1 hesitated
1 as
1 to
1 whether
1 he
1 should
1 venture
1 upon
1 a
1 mutton
1 chop
1 or
1 some
1 bacon
1 deciding
1 finally
1 in
1 favor
1 of
1 the
1 latter
1 upon
1 the
1 reflection
1 that
1 any
1 fellow
1 could
1 see
1 whether
1 bacon
1 were
1 properly
1 frizzled
1 up
1 while
1 as
1 to
1 a
1 chop
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 seeing
1 anything
1 about
1 it
1 till
1 one
1 cut
1 it
1 He
1 therefore
1 invested
1 in
1 a
1 pound
1 of
1 prime
1 streaky
1 iltshire
1 bacon
1 the
1 very
1 best
1 as
1 the
1 shopman
1 informed
1 him
1 that
1 could
1 be
1 bought
1 He
1 returned
1 carrying
1 all
1 his
1 purchases
1 with
1 the
1 exception
1 of
1 the
1 hardware
1 Then
1 he
1 inquired
1 of
1 his
1 landlady
1 where
1 he
1 could
1 get
1 coal
1 The
1 green
1 grocer
1 s
1 round
1 the
1 corner
1 the
1 landlady
1 said
1 Tell
1 him
1 to
1 send
1 in
1 a
1 hundredweight
1 of
1 the
1 best
1 that
1 s
1 a
1 shilling
1 and
1 you
1 ll
1 want
1 some
1 firewood
1 too
1 The
1 coal
1 arrived
1 in
1 the
1 course
1 of
1 the
1 afternoon
1 and
1 at
1 half
1 past
1 six
1 the
1 porter
1 came
1 in
1 with
1 Frank
1 s
1 trunk
1 He
1 had
1 by
1 this
1 time
1 lit
1 a
1 fire
1 and
1 while
1 the
1 water
1 was
1 boiling
1 got
1 some
1 of
1 his
1 things
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 box
1 and
1 by
1 hanging
1 some
1 clothes
1 on
1 the
1 pegs
1 on
1 the
1 back
1 of
1 the
1 door
1 and
1 by
1 putting
1 the
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 favorite
1 books
1 he
1 had
1 brought
1 with
1 him
1 on
1 to
1 the
1 mantelpiece
1 he
1 gave
1 the
1 room
1 a
1 more
1 homelike
1 appearance
1 He
1 enjoyed
1 his
1 tea
1 all
1 the
1 more
1 from
1 the
1 novelty
1 of
1 having
1 to
1 prepare
1 it
1 himself
1 and
1 succeeded
1 very
1 fairly
1 for
1 a
1 first
1 attempt
1 with
1 his
1 bacon
1 hen
1 tea
1 was
1 over
1 he
1 first
1 washed
1 up
1 the
1 things
1 and
1 then
1 started
1 for
1 a
1 ramble
1 He
1 followed
1 the
1 broad
1 straight
1 road
1 to
1 aterloo
1 Bridge
1 stood
1 for
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 looking
1 at
1 the
1 river
1 and
1 then
1 crossed
1 into
1 the
1 Strand
1 The
1 lamps
1 were
1 now
1 alight
1 and
1 the
1 brightness
1 and
1 bustle
1 of
1 the
1 scene
1 greatly
1 interested
1 him
1 At
1 nine
1 o
1 clock
1 he
1 returned
1 to
1 his
1 lodgings
1 but
1 was
1 again
1 obliged
1 to
1 sally
1 out
1 as
1 he
1 found
1 he
1 had
1 forgotten
1 candles
1 After
1 breakfast
1 next
1 morning
1 he
1 went
1 out
1 and
1 bought
1 a
1 newspaper
1 and
1 set
1 himself
1 to
1 work
1 to
1 study
1 the
1 advertisements
1 He
1 was
1 dismayed
1 to
1 find
1 how
1 many
1 more
1 applicants
1 there
1 were
1 for
1 places
1 than
1 places
1 requiring
1 to
1 be
1 filled
1 All
1 the
1 persons
1 advertising
1 were
1 older
1 than
1 himself
1 and
1 seemed
1 to
1 possess
1 various
1 accomplishments
1 in
1 the
1 way
1 of
1 languages
1 many
1 too
1 could
1 be
1 strongly
1 recommended
1 from
1 their
1 last
1 situation
1 The
1 prospect
1 did
1 not
1 look
1 hopeful
1 In
1 the
1 first
1 place
1 he
1 had
1 looked
1 to
1 see
1 if
1 any
1 required
1 boy
1 clerks
1 but
1 this
1 species
1 of
1 assistant
1 appeared
1 little
1 in
1 demand
1 and
1 then
1 although
1 he
1 hoped
1 that
1 it
1 would
1 not
1 come
1 to
1 that
1 he
1 ran
1 his
1 eye
1 down
1 the
1 columns
1 to
1 see
1 if
1 any
1 required
1 errand
1 boys
1 or
1 lads
1 in
1 manufacturing
1 businesses
1 He
1 found
1 however
1 no
1 such
1 advertisements
1 However
1 as
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 himself
1 it
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 expected
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 find
1 a
1 place
1 waiting
1 for
1 him
1 on
1 the
1 very
1 day
1 after
1 his
1 arrival
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 ought
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 live
1 for
1 a
1 year
1 on
1 his
1 five
1 and
1 twenty
1 pounds
1 at
1 this
1 reflection
1 his
1 spirits
1 rose
1 and
1 he
1 went
1 out
1 again
1 for
1 a
1 walk
1 For
1 the
1 first
1 week
1 indeed
1 of
1 his
1 arrival
1 in
1 London
1 Frank
1 did
1 not
1 set
1 himself
1 very
1 earnestly
1 to
1 work
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 a
1 situation
1 In
1 his
1 walks
1 about
1 the
1 streets
1 he
1 several
1 times
1 observed
1 cards
1 in
1 the
1 window
1 indicating
1 that
1 an
1 errand
1 boy
1 was
1 wanted
1 He
1 resolved
1 however
1 that
1 this
1 should
1 be
1 the
1 last
1 resource
1 which
1 he
1 would
1 adopt
1 as
1 he
1 would
1 much
1 prefer
1 to
1 go
1 to
1 work
1 as
1 a
1 common
1 lad
1 in
1 a
1 factory
1 to
1 serving
1 in
1 a
1 shop
1 After
1 the
1 first
1 week
1 he
1 answered
1 many
1 advertisements
1 but
1 in
1 no
1 case
1 received
1 a
1 reply
1 In
1 one
1 case
1 in
1 which
1 it
1 was
1 stated
1 that
1 a
1 lad
1 who
1 could
1 write
1 a
1 good
1 fast
1 hand
1 was
1 required
1 in
1 an
1 office
1 wages
1 to
1 begin
1 with
1 eight
1 shillings
1 a
1 week
1 he
1 called
1 two
1 days
1 after
1 writing
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 small
1 office
1 with
1 a
1 solitary
1 clerk
1 sitting
1 in
1 it
1 The
1 latter
1 upon
1 learning
1 Frank
1 s
1 business
1 replied
1 with
1 some
1 exasperation
1 that
1 his
1 mind
1 was
1 being
1 worried
1 out
1 by
1 boys
1 e
1 have
1 had
1 four
1 hundred
1 and
1 thirty
1 letters
1 he
1 said
1 and
1 I
1 should
1 think
1 that
1 a
1 hundred
1 boys
1 must
1 have
1 called
1 e
1 took
1 the
1 first
1 who
1 applied
1 and
1 all
1 the
1 other
1 letters
1 were
1 chucked
1 into
1 the
1 fire
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 we
1 saw
1 what
1 they
1 were
1 about
1 Frank
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 street
1 greatly
1 disheartened
1 Four
1 hundred
1 and
1 thirty
1 letters
1 he
1 said
1 Four
1 hundred
1 and
1 thirty
1 other
1 fellows
1 on
1 the
1 lookout
1 just
1 as
1 I
1 am
1 for
1 a
1 place
1 as
1 a
1 boy
1 clerk
1 and
1 lots
1 of
1 them
1 no
1 doubt
1 with
1 friends
1 and
1 relations
1 to
1 recommend
1 them
1 The
1 lookout
1 seems
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 bad
1 one
1 Two
1 days
1 later
1 when
1 Frank
1 was
1 walking
1 along
1 the
1 strand
1 he
1 noticed
1 the
1 placards
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 a
1 theater
1 Gallery
1 one
1 shilling
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 himself
1 I
1 will
1 go
1 I
1 have
1 never
1 seen
1 a
1 theater
1 yet
1 The
1 play
1 was
1 The
1 Merchant
1 of
1 Venice
1 and
1 Frank
1 sat
1 in
1 rapt
1 attention
1 and
1 interest
1 through
1 it
1 hen
1 the
1 performance
1 was
1 over
1 he
1 walked
1 briskly
1 homewards
1 hen
1 he
1 had
1 proceeded
1 some
1 distance
1 he
1 saw
1 a
1 glare
1 in
1 the
1 sky
1 ahead
1 and
1 presently
1 a
1 steam
1 engine
1 dashed
1 past
1 him
1 at
1 full
1 speed
1 That
1 must
1 be
1 a
1 house
1 on
1 fire
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 never
1 seen
1 a
1 fire
1 and
1 he
1 broke
1 into
1 a
1 run
1 Others
1 were
1 running
1 in
1 the
1 same
1 direction
1 and
1 as
1 he
1 passed
1 the
1 Elephant
1 and
1 Castle
1 the
1 crowd
1 became
1 thicker
1 and
1 when
1 within
1 fifty
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 house
1 he
1 could
1 no
1 longer
1 advance
1 He
1 could
1 see
1 the
1 flames
1 now
1 rising
1 high
1 in
1 the
1 air
1 A
1 horrible
1 fear
1 seized
1 him
1 It
1 must
1 be
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 to
1 himself
1 either
1 our
1 house
1 or
1 the
1 one
1 next
1 door
1 It
1 was
1 in
1 vain
1 that
1 he
1 pressed
1 forward
1 to
1 see
1 more
1 nearly
1 A
1 line
1 of
1 policemen
1 was
1 drawn
1 up
1 across
1 the
1 road
1 to
1 keep
1 a
1 large
1 space
1 clear
1 for
1 the
1 firemen
1 Behind
1 the
1 policemen
1 the
1 crowd
1 were
1 thickly
1 packed
1 Frank
1 inquired
1 of
1 many
1 who
1 stood
1 near
1 him
1 if
1 they
1 could
1 tell
1 him
1 the
1 number
1 of
1 the
1 house
1 which
1 was
1 on
1 fire
1 but
1 none
1 could
1 inform
1 him
1 Presently
1 the
1 flames
1 began
1 to
1 die
1 away
1 and
1 the
1 crowd
1 to
1 disperse
1 At
1 length
1 Frank
1 reached
1 the
1 first
1 line
1 of
1 spectators
1 Can
1 you
1 tell
1 me
1 the
1 number
1 of
1 the
1 houses
1 which
1 are
1 burned
1 Frank
1 said
1 to
1 a
1 policeman
1 There
1 are
1 two
1 of
1 them
1 the
1 policeman
1 said
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 four
1 and
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 five
1 A
1 hundred
1 and
1 four
1 caught
1 first
1 and
1 they
1 say
1 that
1 a
1 woman
1 and
1 two
1 children
1 have
1 been
1 burned
1 to
1 death
1 That
1 is
1 where
1 I
1 live
1 Frank
1 cried
1 Oh
1 please
1 let
1 me
1 pass
1 I
1 ll
1 pass
1 you
1 in
1 the
1 policeman
1 said
1 good
1 naturedly
1 and
1 he
1 led
1 him
1 forward
1 to
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 the
1 engines
1 were
1 playing
1 upon
1 the
1 burning
1 houses
1 Is
1 it
1 true
1 mate
1 he
1 asked
1 a
1 fireman
1 that
1 a
1 woman
1 and
1 two
1 children
1 have
1 been
1 burned
1 It
1 s
1 true
1 enough
1 the
1 fireman
1 said
1 The
1 landlady
1 and
1 her
1 children
1 Her
1 husband
1 was
1 a
1 porter
1 at
1 the
1 railway
1 station
1 and
1 had
1 been
1 detained
1 on
1 overtime
1 He
1 only
1 came
1 back
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 ago
1 and
1 he
1 s
1 been
1 going
1 on
1 like
1 a
1 madman
1 and
1 he
1 pointed
1 to
1 the
1 porter
1 who
1 was
1 sitting
1 down
1 on
1 the
1 doorsteps
1 of
1 a
1 house
1 facing
1 his
1 own
1 with
1 his
1 face
1 hidden
1 in
1 his
1 hands
1 Frank
1 went
1 and
1 sat
1 down
1 beside
1 him
1 My
1 poor
1 fellow
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 am
1 sorry
1 for
1 you
1 Frank
1 had
1 had
1 many
1 chats
1 with
1 his
1 landlord
1 of
1 an
1 evening
1 and
1 had
1 become
1 quite
1 friendly
1 with
1 him
1 and
1 his
1 wife
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 believe
1 it
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 huskily
1 Just
1 to
1 think
1 hen
1 I
1 went
1 out
1 this
1 morning
1 there
1 was
1 Jane
1 and
1 the
1 kids
1 as
1 well
1 and
1 as
1 happy
1 as
1 ever
1 and
1 there
1 where
1 are
1 they
1 now
1 Happier
1 still
1 Frank
1 said
1 gently
1 I
1 lost
1 my
1 mother
1 just
1 as
1 suddenly
1 only
1 five
1 weeks
1 ago
1 I
1 went
1 out
1 for
1 a
1 walk
1 leaving
1 her
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 usual
1 and
1 when
1 I
1 came
1 back
1 she
1 was
1 dead
1 so
1 I
1 can
1 feel
1 for
1 you
1 with
1 all
1 my
1 heart
1 I
1 would
1 have
1 given
1 my
1 life
1 for
1 them
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 wiping
1 his
1 eyes
1 willing
1 I
1 m
1 sure
1 you
1 would
1 Frank
1 answered
1 There
1 s
1 the
1 home
1 gone
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 with
1 all
1 the
1 things
1 that
1 it
1 took
1 ten
1 years
1 savings
1 of
1 Jane
1 and
1 me
1 to
1 buy
1 not
1 that
1 that
1 matters
1 one
1 way
1 or
1 the
1 other
1 now
1 And
1 your
1 traps
1 are
1 gone
1 too
1 I
1 suppose
1 sir
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 replied
1 quietly
1 I
1 have
1 lost
1 my
1 clothes
1 and
1 twenty
1 -three
1 pounds
1 in
1 money
1 every
1 penny
1 I
1 ve
1 got
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 except
1 half
1 a
1 crown
1 in
1 my
1 pocket
1 And
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 say
1 nothing
1 about
1 it
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 roused
1 into
1 animation
1 But
1 there
1 perhaps
1 you
1 ve
1 friends
1 as
1 will
1 make
1 it
1 up
1 to
1 you
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 one
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 Frank
1 answered
1 whom
1 I
1 could
1 ask
1 to
1 give
1 me
1 a
1 helping
1 hand
1 ell
1 you
1 are
1 a
1 plucky
1 chap
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 That
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 knock
1 down
1 blow
1 to
1 a
1 man
1 let
1 alone
1 a
1 boy
1 like
1 you
1 hat
1 are
1 you
1 going
1 to
1 do
1 now
1 he
1 asked
1 forgetting
1 for
1 the
1 moment
1 his
1 own
1 loss
1 in
1 his
1 interest
1 in
1 his
1 companion
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 Frank
1 replied
1 Perhaps
1 he
1 added
1 seeing
1 that
1 the
1 interest
1 in
1 his
1 condition
1 roused
1 the
1 poor
1 fellow
1 from
1 the
1 thought
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 deep
1 sorrow
1 you
1 might
1 give
1 me
1 some
1 advice
1 I
1 was
1 thinking
1 of
1 getting
1 a
1 place
1 in
1 an
1 office
1 but
1 of
1 course
1 I
1 must
1 give
1 that
1 up
1 now
1 and
1 should
1 be
1 thankful
1 to
1 get
1 anything
1 by
1 which
1 I
1 can
1 earn
1 my
1 bread
1 You
1 come
1 along
1 with
1 me
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 rising
1 You
1 ve
1 done
1 me
1 a
1 heap
1 of
1 good
1 It
1 s
1 no
1 use
1 sitting
1 here
1 I
1 shall
1 go
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 station
1 and
1 turn
1 in
1 on
1 some
1 sacks
1 If
1 you
1 ve
1 nothing
1 better
1 to
1 do
1 and
1 nowhere
1 to
1 go
1 to
1 you
1 come
1 along
1 with
1 me
1 e
1 will
1 talk
1 it
1 all
1 over
1 Pleased
1 to
1 have
1 some
1 one
1 to
1 talk
1 to
1 and
1 glad
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 not
1 have
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 a
1 place
1 to
1 sleep
1 Frank
1 accompanied
1 the
1 porter
1 to
1 the
1 station
1 ith
1 a
1 word
1 or
1 two
1 to
1 the
1 nightmen
1 on
1 duty
1 the
1 porter
1 led
1 the
1 way
1 to
1 a
1 shed
1 near
1 the
1 station
1 where
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 sacks
1 were
1 heaped
1 in
1 a
1 corner
1 Now
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 I
1 will
1 light
1 a
1 pipe
1 It
1 s
1 against
1 the
1 regulations
1 but
1 that
1 s
1 neither
1 here
1 nor
1 there
1 now
1 Now
1 if
1 you
1 re
1 not
1 sleepy
1 would
1 you
1 mind
1 talking
1 to
1 me
1 Tell
1 me
1 something
1 about
1 yourself
1 and
1 how
1 you
1 come
1 to
1 be
1 alone
1 here
1 in
1 London
1 It
1 does
1 me
1 good
1 to
1 talk
1 It
1 prevents
1 me
1 from
1 thinking
1 There
1 is
1 very
1 little
1 to
1 tell
1 Frank
1 said
1 and
1 he
1 related
1 to
1 him
1 the
1 circumstances
1 of
1 the
1 deaths
1 of
1 his
1 father
1 and
1 mother
1 and
1 how
1 it
1 came
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 alone
1 in
1 London
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 a
1 place
1 You
1 re
1 in
1 a
1 fix
1 the
1 porter
1 said
1 Yes
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 that
1 You
1 see
1 you
1 re
1 young
1 for
1 most
1 work
1 and
1 you
1 never
1 had
1 no
1 practice
1 with
1 horses
1 or
1 you
1 might
1 have
1 got
1 a
1 place
1 to
1 drive
1 a
1 light
1 cart
1 Then
1 again
1 your
1 knowing
1 nothing
1 of
1 London
1 is
1 against
1 you
1 as
1 an
1 errand
1 boy
1 and
1 what
1 s
1 worse
1 than
1 all
1 this
1 anyone
1 can
1 see
1 with
1 half
1 an
1 eye
1 that
1 you
1 re
1 a
1 gentleman
1 and
1 not
1 accustomed
1 to
1 hard
1 work
1 However
1 we
1 will
1 think
1 it
1 over
1 The
1 daylight
1 s
1 breaking
1 now
1 and
1 I
1 has
1 to
1 be
1 at
1 work
1 at
1 six
1 But
1 look
1 ye
1 here
1 young
1 fellow
1 tomorrow
1 I
1 ve
1 got
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 a
1 room
1 and
1 when
1 I
1 gets
1 it
1 there
1 s
1 half
1 of
1 it
1 for
1 you
1 if
1 you
1 re
1 not
1 too
1 proud
1 to
1 accept
1 it
1 It
1 will
1 be
1 doing
1 me
1 a
1 real
1 kindness
1 I
1 can
1 tell
1 you
1 for
1 what
1 I
1 am
1 to
1 do
1 alone
1 of
1 an
1 evening
1 without
1 Jane
1 and
1 the
1 kids
1 God
1 knows
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 believe
1 they
1 re
1 gone
1 yet
1 Then
1 the
1 man
1 threw
1 himself
1 down
1 upon
1 the
1 sacks
1 and
1 broke
1 into
1 sobs
1 Frank
1 listened
1 for
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 till
1 these
1 gradually
1 died
1 away
1 and
1 he
1 knew
1 by
1 the
1 regular
1 breathing
1 that
1 his
1 companion
1 was
1 asleep
1 It
1 was
1 long
1 after
1 this
1 before
1 be
1 himself
1 closed
1 his
1 eyes
1 The
1 position
1 did
1 indeed
1 appear
1 a
1 dark
1 one
1 Thanks
1 to
1 the
1 offer
1 of
1 his
1 companion
1 which
1 he
1 at
1 once
1 resolved
1 to
1 accept
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 he
1 would
1 have
1 a
1 roof
1 to
1 sleep
1 under
1 But
1 this
1 could
1 not
1 last
1 and
1 what
1 was
1 he
1 to
1 do
1 Perhaps
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 wrong
1 in
1 not
1 writing
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 He
1 even
1 felt
1 sure
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 wrong
1 but
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 ten
1 times
1 as
1 hard
1 to
1 write
1 now
1 He
1 would
1 rather
1 starve
1 than
1 do
1 this
1 How
1 was
1 he
1 to
1 earn
1 his
1 living
1 He
1 would
1 he
1 determined
1 at
1 any
1 rate
1 try
1 for
1 a
1 few
1 days
1 to
1 procure
1 a
1 place
1 as
1 an
1 errand
1 boy
1 If
1 that
1 failed
1 he
1 would
1 sell
1 his
1 clothes
1 and
1 get
1 a
1 rough
1 working
1 suit
1 He
1 was
1 sure
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 have
1 more
1 chance
1 of
1 obtaining
1 work
1 in
1 such
1 a
1 dress
1 than
1 in
1 his
1 present
1 attire
1 Musing
1 thus
1 Frank
1 at
1 last
1 dropped
1 off
1 to
1 sleep
1 hen
1 he
1 woke
1 he
1 found
1 himself
1 alone
1 his
1 companion
1 having
1 left
1 without
1 disturbing
1 him
1 From
1 the
1 noises
1 around
1 him
1 of
1 trains
1 coming
1 in
1 and
1 out
1 Frank
1 judged
1 that
1 the
1 hour
1 was
1 late
1 I
1 have
1 done
1 one
1 wise
1 thing
1 he
1 said
1 anyhow
1 and
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 it
1 s
1 the
1 only
1 one
1 in
1 leaving
1 my
1 watch
1 with
1 the
1 doctor
1 to
1 keep
1 He
1 pointed
1 out
1 that
1 I
1 might
1 have
1 it
1 stolen
1 if
1 I
1 carried
1 it
1 and
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 use
1 in
1 keeping
1 it
1 shut
1 up
1 in
1 a
1 box
1 Very
1 possibly
1 it
1 might
1 be
1 stolen
1 by
1 the
1 dishonesty
1 of
1 a
1 servant
1 That
1 s
1 safe
1 anyhow
1 and
1 it
1 is
1 my
1 only
1 worldly
1 possession
1 except
1 the
1 books
1 and
1 I
1 would
1 rather
1 go
1 into
1 the
1 workhouse
1 than
1 part
1 with
1 either
1 of
1 them
1 Rising
1 he
1 made
1 his
1 way
1 into
1 the
1 station
1 where
1 he
1 found
1 the
1 porter
1 at
1 his
1 usual
1 work
1 I
1 would
1 not
1 wake
1 you
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 you
1 were
1 sleeping
1 so
1 quiet
1 and
1 I
1 knew
1 twas
1 no
1 use
1 your
1 getting
1 up
1 early
1 I
1 shall
1 go
1 out
1 and
1 settle
1 for
1 a
1 room
1 at
1 dinner
1 time
1 If
1 you
1 will
1 come
1 here
1 at
1 six
1 o
1 clock
1 we
1 ll
1 go
1 off
1 together
1 The
1 mates
1 have
1 all
1 been
1 very
1 kind
1 and
1 have
1 been
1 making
1 a
1 collection
1 to
1 bury
1 my
1 poor
1 girl
1 and
1 the
1 kids
1 They
1 ve
1 found
1 em
1 and
1 the
1 inquest
1 is
1 tomorrow
1 so
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 off
1 work
1 The
1 governor
1 has
1 offered
1 me
1 a
1 week
1 but
1 there
1 I
1 d
1 rather
1 be
1 here
1 where
1 there
1 s
1 no
1 time
1 for
1 thinking
1 than
1 hanging
1 about
1 with
1 nothing
1 to
1 do
1 but
1 to
1 drink
1 CHAPTER
1 VI
1 THE
1 FIRST
1 STEP
1 All
1 that
1 day
1 Frank
1 tramped
1 the
1 streets
1 He
1 went
1 into
1 many
1 shops
1 where
1 he
1 saw
1 notices
1 that
1 an
1 errand
1 boy
1 was
1 required
1 but
1 everywhere
1 without
1 success
1 He
1 perceived
1 at
1 once
1 that
1 his
1 appearance
1 was
1 against
1 him
1 and
1 he
1 either
1 received
1 the
1 abrupt
1 answer
1 of
1 You
1 re
1 not
1 the
1 sort
1 of
1 chap
1 for
1 my
1 place
1 or
1 an
1 equally
1 decided
1 refusal
1 upon
1 the
1 grounds
1 that
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 know
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 or
1 that
1 they
1 preferred
1 one
1 who
1 had
1 parents
1 who
1 lived
1 close
1 by
1 and
1 could
1 speak
1 for
1 him
1 At
1 six
1 o
1 clock
1 he
1 rejoined
1 the
1 porter
1 He
1 brought
1 with
1 him
1 some
1 bread
1 and
1 butter
1 and
1 a
1 piece
1 of
1 bacon
1 hen
1 on
1 arriving
1 at
1 the
1 lodging
1 of
1 his
1 new
1 friend
1 a
1 neat
1 room
1 with
1 two
1 small
1 beds
1 in
1 it
1 he
1 produced
1 and
1 opened
1 his
1 parcel
1 the
1 porter
1 said
1 angrily
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 do
1 that
1 again
1 young
1 fellow
1 or
1 we
1 shall
1 have
1 words
1 You
1 re
1 just
1 coming
1 to
1 stop
1 with
1 me
1 for
1 a
1 bit
1 till
1 you
1 see
1 your
1 way
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 not
1 going
1 to
1 have
1 you
1 bring
1 things
1 in
1 here
1 My
1 money
1 is
1 good
1 for
1 two
1 months
1 and
1 your
1 living
1 here
1 with
1 me
1 won
1 t
1 cost
1 three
1 shillings
1 a
1 week
1 So
1 don
1 t
1 you
1 hurt
1 my
1 feelings
1 by
1 bringing
1 things
1 home
1 again
1 There
1 don
1 t
1 say
1 no
1 more
1 about
1 it
1 Frank
1 seeing
1 that
1 his
1 companion
1 was
1 really
1 in
1 earnest
1 said
1 no
1 more
1 and
1 was
1 the
1 less
1 reluctant
1 to
1 accept
1 the
1 other
1 s
1 kindness
1 as
1 he
1 saw
1 that
1 his
1 society
1 was
1 really
1 a
1 great
1 relief
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 his
1 trouble
1 After
1 the
1 meal
1 they
1 sallied
1 out
1 to
1 a
1 second
1 hand
1 clothes
1 shop
1 Here
1 Frank
1 disposed
1 of
1 his
1 things
1 and
1 received
1 in
1 return
1 a
1 good
1 suit
1 of
1 clothes
1 fit
1 for
1 a
1 working
1 lad
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 how
1 it
1 is
1 the
1 porter
1 said
1 as
1 they
1 sat
1 together
1 afterwards
1 but
1 a
1 gentleman
1 looks
1 like
1 a
1 gentleman
1 put
1 him
1 in
1 what
1 clothes
1 you
1 will
1 I
1 could
1 have
1 sworn
1 to
1 your
1 being
1 that
1 if
1 I
1 d
1 never
1 seen
1 you
1 before
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 make
1 it
1 out
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 what
1 it
1 is
1 but
1 there
1 s
1 certainly
1 something
1 in
1 gentle
1 blood
1 whatever
1 you
1 may
1 say
1 about
1 it
1 Some
1 of
1 my
1 mates
1 are
1 forever
1 saying
1 that
1 one
1 man
1 s
1 as
1 good
1 as
1 another
1 Now
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 mean
1 to
1 say
1 they
1 ain
1 t
1 as
1 good
1 but
1 what
1 I
1 say
1 is
1 as
1 they
1 ain
1 t
1 the
1 same
1 One
1 man
1 ain
1 t
1 the
1 same
1 as
1 another
1 any
1 more
1 than
1 a
1 race
1 horse
1 is
1 the
1 same
1 as
1 a
1 cart
1 horse
1 They
1 both
1 sprang
1 from
1 the
1 same
1 stock
1 at
1 least
1 so
1 they
1 says
1 but
1 breeding
1 and
1 feeding
1 and
1 care
1 has
1 made
1 one
1 into
1 a
1 slim
1 boned
1 creature
1 as
1 can
1 run
1 like
1 the
1 wind
1 while
1 the
1 other
1 has
1 got
1 big
1 bones
1 and
1 weight
1 and
1 can
1 drag
1 his
1 two
1 ton
1 after
1 him
1 without
1 turning
1 a
1 hair
1 Now
1 I
1 take
1 it
1 it
1 s
1 the
1 same
1 thing
1 with
1 gentlefolks
1 and
1 working
1 men
1 It
1 isn
1 t
1 that
1 one
1 s
1 bigger
1 than
1 the
1 other
1 for
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 see
1 much
1 difference
1 that
1 way
1 but
1 a
1 gentleman
1 s
1 lighter
1 in
1 the
1 bone
1 and
1 his
1 hands
1 and
1 his
1 feet
1 are
1 smaller
1 and
1 he
1 carries
1 himself
1 altogether
1 different
1 His
1 voice
1 gets
1 a
1 different
1 tone
1 hy
1 Lord
1 bless
1 you
1 when
1 I
1 hears
1 two
1 men
1 coming
1 along
1 the
1 platform
1 at
1 night
1 even
1 when
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 see
1 em
1 and
1 can
1 t
1 hear
1 what
1 they
1 says
1 only
1 the
1 tone
1 of
1 their
1 voices
1 I
1 knows
1 just
1 as
1 well
1 whether
1 it
1 s
1 a
1 first
1 class
1 or
1 a
1 third
1 door
1 as
1 I
1 ve
1 got
1 to
1 open
1 as
1 if
1 I
1 saw
1 em
1 in
1 the
1 daylight
1 Rum
1 ain
1 t
1 it
1 Frank
1 had
1 never
1 thought
1 the
1 matter
1 out
1 and
1 could
1 only
1 give
1 his
1 general
1 assent
1 to
1 his
1 companion
1 s
1 proposition
1 Now
1 the
1 porter
1 went
1 on
1 if
1 you
1 go
1 into
1 a
1 factory
1 or
1 workshop
1 I
1 ll
1 bet
1 a
1 crown
1 to
1 a
1 penny
1 that
1 before
1 you
1 ve
1 been
1 there
1 a
1 week
1 you
1 ll
1 get
1 called
1 Gentleman
1 Jack
1 or
1 some
1 such
1 name
1 You
1 see
1 if
1 you
1 ain
1 t
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 care
1 what
1 they
1 call
1 me
1 Frank
1 laughed
1 so
1 that
1 they
1 ll
1 take
1 me
1 into
1 the
1 factory
1 All
1 in
1 good
1 time
1 the
1 porter
1 said
1 don
1 t
1 you
1 hurry
1 yourself
1 As
1 long
1 as
1 you
1 can
1 stay
1 here
1 you
1 ll
1 be
1 heartily
1 welcome
1 Just
1 look
1 what
1 a
1 comfort
1 it
1 is
1 to
1 have
1 you
1 sitting
1 here
1 sociable
1 and
1 comfortable
1 You
1 don
1 t
1 suppose
1 I
1 could
1 have
1 sat
1 here
1 alone
1 in
1 this
1 room
1 if
1 you
1 hadn
1 t
1 been
1 here
1 I
1 should
1 have
1 been
1 in
1 a
1 public
1 house
1 making
1 a
1 beast
1 of
1 myself
1 and
1 spending
1 as
1 much
1 money
1 as
1 would
1 keep
1 the
1 pair
1 of
1 us
1 Day
1 after
1 day
1 Frank
1 went
1 out
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 work
1 In
1 his
1 tramps
1 he
1 visited
1 scores
1 of
1 workshops
1 and
1 factories
1 but
1 without
1 success
1 Either
1 they
1 did
1 not
1 want
1 boys
1 or
1 they
1 declined
1 altogether
1 to
1 take
1 one
1 who
1 had
1 no
1 experience
1 in
1 work
1 and
1 had
1 no
1 references
1 in
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 Frank
1 took
1 his
1 breakfast
1 and
1 tea
1 with
1 the
1 porter
1 and
1 was
1 glad
1 that
1 the
1 latter
1 had
1 his
1 dinner
1 at
1 the
1 station
1 as
1 a
1 penny
1 loaf
1 served
1 his
1 purposes
1 One
1 day
1 in
1 his
1 walks
1 Frank
1 entered
1 Covent
1 Garden
1 and
1 stood
1 looking
1 on
1 at
1 the
1 bustle
1 and
1 flow
1 of
1 business
1 for
1 it
1 happened
1 to
1 be
1 market
1 day
1 He
1 leaned
1 against
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 columns
1 of
1 the
1 piazza
1 eating
1 the
1 bread
1 he
1 had
1 just
1 bought
1 Presently
1 a
1 sharp
1 faced
1 lad
1 a
1 year
1 or
1 two
1 younger
1 than
1 himself
1 came
1 up
1 to
1 him
1 Give
1 us
1 a
1 hit
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 ain
1 t
1 tasted
1 nothing
1 today
1 Frank
1 broke
1 the
1 bread
1 in
1 half
1 and
1 gave
1 a
1 portion
1 to
1 him
1 hat
1 a
1 lot
1 there
1 is
1 going
1 on
1 here
1 Frank
1 said
1 Law
1 the
1 boy
1 answered
1 that
1 ain
1 t
1 nothing
1 to
1 what
1 it
1 is
1 of
1 a
1 morning
1 That
1 s
1 the
1 time
1 special
1 on
1 the
1 mornings
1 of
1 the
1 flower
1 market
1 It
1 s
1 hard
1 lines
1 if
1 a
1 chap
1 can
1 t
1 pick
1 up
1 a
1 tanner
1 or
1 even
1 a
1 bob
1 then
1 How
1 Frank
1 asked
1 eagerly
1 hy
1 by
1 holding
1 horses
1 helping
1 to
1 carry
1 out
1 plants
1 and
1 such
1 like
1 You
1 seems
1 a
1 green
1 un
1 you
1 do
1 Up
1 from
1 the
1 country
1 eh
1 Don
1 t
1 seem
1 like
1 one
1 of
1 our
1 sort
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 m
1 just
1 up
1 from
1 the
1 country
1 I
1 thought
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 easy
1 to
1 get
1 a
1 place
1 in
1 London
1 but
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 find
1 it
1 so
1 A
1 place
1 the
1 boy
1 repeated
1 scornfully
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 any
1 one
1 to
1 see
1 me
1 in
1 a
1 place
1 It
1 s
1 better
1 a
1 hundred
1 times
1 to
1 be
1 your
1 own

1 Frank
1 said
1 That
1 evening
1 Frank
1 told
1 his
1 friend
1 the
1 porter
1 that
1 he
1 thought
1 of
1 going
1 out
1 early
1 next
1 morning
1 to
1 try
1 and
1 pick
1 up
1 odd
1 jobs
1 at
1 Covent
1 Garden
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 think
1 of
1 it
1 the
1 porter
1 said
1 There
1 s
1 nothing
1 worse
1 for
1 a
1 lad
1 than
1 taking
1 to
1 odd
1 jobs
1 It
1 gets
1 him
1 into
1 bad
1 ways
1 and
1 bad
1 company
1 Don
1 t
1 you
1 hurry
1 I
1 have
1 spoken
1 to
1 lots
1 of
1 my
1 mates
1 and
1 they
1 re
1 all
1 on
1 the
1 lookout
1 for
1 you
1 e
1 on
1 the
1 platform
1 can
1 t
1 do
1 much
1 It
1 ain
1 t
1 in
1 our
1 line
1 you
1 see
1 but
1 in
1 the
1 goods
1 department
1 where
1 they
1 are
1 constant
1 with
1 vans
1 and
1 wagons
1 and
1 such
1 like
1 they
1 are
1 likely
1 enough
1 to
1 hear
1 of
1 something
1 before
1 long
1 That
1 night
1 thinking
1 matters
1 over
1 in
1 bed
1 Frank
1 determined
1 to
1 go
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 docks
1 and
1 see
1 if
1 he
1 could
1 get
1 a
1 place
1 as
1 cabin
1 boy
1 He
1 had
1 had
1 this
1 idea
1 in
1 his
1 mind
1 ever
1 since
1 he
1 lost
1 his
1 money
1 and
1 had
1 only
1 put
1 it
1 aside
1 in
1 order
1 that
1 he
1 might
1 if
1 possible
1 get
1 some
1 berth
1 on
1 shore
1 which
1 might
1 seem
1 likely
1 in
1 the
1 end
1 to
1 afford
1 him
1 a
1 means
1 of
1 making
1 his
1 way
1 up
1 again
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 afraid
1 of
1 the
1 roughness
1 of
1 a
1 cabin
1 boy
1 s
1 life
1 it
1 was
1 only
1 because
1 he
1 knew
1 that
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 so
1 very
1 long
1 before
1 working
1 his
1 way
1 up
1 from
1 boy
1 to
1 able
1 bodied
1 seaman
1 he
1 could
1 obtain
1 a
1 mate
1 s
1 certificate
1 and
1 so
1 make
1 a
1 first
1 step
1 up
1 the
1 ladder
1 However
1 he
1 thought
1 that
1 even
1 this
1 would
1 be
1 better
1 than
1 going
1 as
1 a
1 wagoner
1 s
1 boy
1 and
1 he
1 accordingly
1 crossed
1 London
1 Bridge
1 turned
1 down
1 Eastcheap
1 and
1 presently
1 found
1 himself
1 in
1 Ratcliff
1 Highway
1 He
1 was
1 amused
1 here
1 at
1 the
1 nautical
1 character
1 of
1 the
1 shops
1 and
1 presently
1 found
1 himself
1 staring
1 into
1 a
1 window
1 full
1 of
1 foreign
1 birds
1 for
1 the
1 most
1 part
1 alive
1 in
1 cages
1 among
1 which
1 however
1 were
1 a
1 few
1 cases
1 of
1 stuffed
1 birds
1 How
1 stupid
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 he
1 thought
1 to
1 himself
1 I
1 wonder
1 I
1 never
1 thought
1 of
1 it
1 before
1 I
1 can
1 stuff
1 birds
1 and
1 beasts
1 at
1 any
1 rate
1 a
1 deal
1 better
1 than
1 those
1 wooden
1 looking
1 things
1 I
1 might
1 have
1 a
1 chance
1 of
1 getting
1 work
1 at
1 some
1 naturalist
1 s
1 shop
1 I
1 will
1 get
1 a
1 directory
1 and
1 take
1 down
1 all
1 the
1 addresses
1 in
1 London
1 and
1 then
1 go
1 around
1 He
1 now
1 became
1 conscious
1 of
1 a
1 conversation
1 going
1 on
1 between
1 a
1 little
1 old
1 man
1 with
1 a
1 pair
1 of
1 thick
1 horn
1 rimmed
1 spectacles
1 and
1 a
1 sailor
1 who
1 had
1 a
1 dead
1 parrot
1 and
1 a
1 cat
1 in
1 his
1 hand
1 I
1 really
1 cannot
1 undertake
1 them
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 Since
1 the
1 death
1 of
1 my
1 daughter
1 I
1 have
1 had
1 but
1 little
1 time
1 to
1 attend
1 to
1 that
1 branch
1 hat
1 with
1 buying
1 and
1 selling
1 and
1 feeding
1 and
1 attending
1 to
1 the
1 live
1 ones
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 time
1 for
1 stuffing
1 Besides
1 if
1 the
1 things
1 were
1 poisoned
1 they
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 worth
1 stuffing
1 It
1 isn
1 t
1 the
1 question
1 of
1 worth
1 skipper
1 the
1 sailor
1 said
1 and
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 say
1 mind
1 ye
1 that
1 these
1 here
1 critturs
1 was
1 pisoned
1 only
1 if
1 you
1 looks
1 at
1 it
1 that
1 this
1 was
1 the
1 noisiest
1 bird
1 and
1 the
1 worst
1 tempered
1 thievingest
1 cat
1 in
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 -
1 -though
1 Lord
1 bless
1 you
1 my
1 missus
1 wouldn
1 t
1 allow
1 it
1 for
1 worlds
1 -
1 -why
1 you
1 know
1 when
1 they
1 were
1 both
1 found
1 stiff
1 and
1 cold
1 this
1 morning
1 people
1 does
1 have
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 a
1 suspicion
1 as
1 how
1 they
1 ve
1 been
1 pisoned
1 and
1 he
1 winked
1 one
1 eye
1 in
1 a
1 portentous
1 manner
1 and
1 grinned
1 hugely
1 The
1 missus
1 she
1 s
1 in
1 a
1 nice
1 taking
1 screeching
1 and
1 yelling
1 as
1 you
1 might
1 hear
1 her
1 two
1 cables
1 length
1 away
1 and
1 she
1 turns
1 round
1 on
1 me
1 and
1 will
1 have
1 it
1 as
1 I
1 d
1 a
1 hand
1 in
1 the
1 matter
1 ell
1 just
1 to
1 show
1 my
1 innocence
1 I
1 offers
1 to
1 get
1 a
1 glass
1 case
1 for
1 em
1 and
1 have
1 em
1 stuffed
1 if
1 it
1 cost
1 me
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 pounds
1 I
1 wouldn
1 t
1 care
1 if
1 they
1 fell
1 all
1 to
1 pieces
1 a
1 week
1 afterwards
1 so
1 that
1 it
1 pacified
1 the
1 old
1 woman
1 just
1 at
1 present
1 If
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 get
1 em
1 done
1 I
1 shall
1 ship
1 at
1 once
1 for
1 the
1 place
1 will
1 be
1 too
1 hot
1 to
1 hold
1 me
1 So
1 you
1 can
1 t
1 do
1 it
1 nohow
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 shook
1 his
1 head
1 and
1 the
1 sailor
1 was
1 just
1 turning
1 off
1 when
1 Frank
1 went
1 up
1 to
1 him
1 ill
1 you
1 please
1 wait
1 a
1 moment
1 Can
1 I
1 speak
1 to
1 you
1 sir
1 a
1 minute
1 he
1 asked
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 The
1 naturalist
1 went
1 into
1 his
1 shop
1 and
1 Frank
1 followed
1 him
1 I
1 can
1 stuff
1 birds
1 and
1 animals
1 sir
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 think
1 I
1 really
1 stuff
1 them
1 well
1 for
1 some
1 which
1 I
1 did
1 for
1 amusement
1 were
1 sold
1 at
1 ten
1 shillings
1 a
1 case
1 and
1 the
1 man
1 who
1 bought
1 them
1 of
1 me
1 told
1 me
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 worth
1 four
1 times
1 as
1 much
1 in
1 London
1 I
1 am
1 out
1 of
1 work
1 sir
1 and
1 very
1 very
1 anxious
1 to
1 get
1 my
1 living
1 You
1 will
1 find
1 me
1 hard
1 working
1 and
1 honest
1 Do
1 give
1 me
1 a
1 chance
1 Let
1 me
1 stuff
1 that
1 cat
1 and
1 parrot
1 for
1 the
1 sailor
1 If
1 you
1 are
1 not
1 satisfied
1 then
1 I
1 will
1 go
1 away
1 and
1 charge
1 nothing
1 for
1 it
1 The
1 man
1 looked
1 at
1 him
1 keenly
1 I
1 will
1 at
1 any
1 rate
1 give
1 you
1 a
1 trial
1 he
1 said
1 Then
1 he
1 went
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 and
1 called
1 in
1 the
1 sailor
1 This
1 lad
1 tells
1 me
1 he
1 can
1 stuff
1 birds
1 I
1 know
1 nothing
1 about
1 him
1 but
1 I
1 believe
1 he
1 is
1 speaking
1 truthfully
1 If
1 you
1 like
1 to
1 intrust
1 them
1 to
1 him
1 he
1 will
1 do
1 his
1 best
1 If
1 you
1 re
1 not
1 satisfied
1 he
1 will
1 make
1 no
1 charge
1 Much
1 pleased
1 at
1 seeing
1 a
1 way
1 out
1 of
1 his
1 dilemma
1 the
1 sailor
1 placed
1 the
1 dead
1 animals
1 on
1 the
1 counter
1 Now
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 you
1 can
1 take
1 these
1 out
1 into
1 the
1 back
1 yard
1 and
1 skin
1 them
1 Then
1 you
1 can
1 go
1 to
1 work
1 in
1 that
1 back
1 room
1 You
1 will
1 find
1 arsenical
1 soap
1 cotton
1 wool
1 wires
1 and
1 everything
1 else
1 you
1 require
1 there
1 This
1 has
1 been
1 a
1 fine
1 cat
1 he
1 said
1 looking
1 at
1 the
1 animal
1 Yes
1 it
1 has
1 been
1 a
1 splendid
1 creature
1 Frank
1 answered
1 It
1 is
1 a
1 magnificent
1 macaw
1 also
1 Ah
1 you
1 know
1 it
1 is
1 a
1 macaw
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 Of
1 course
1 Frank
1 said
1 simply
1 it
1 has
1 a
1 tail
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 then
1 furnished
1 Frank
1 with
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 sharp
1 knives
1 and
1 scissors
1 Taking
1 the
1 bird
1 and
1 cat
1 he
1 went
1 out
1 into
1 the
1 yard
1 and
1 in
1 the
1 course
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 had
1 skinned
1 them
1 both
1 Then
1 he
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 shop
1 and
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 in
1 the
1 room
1 behind
1 May
1 I
1 make
1 a
1 group
1 of
1 them
1 he
1 asked
1 Do
1 them
1 just
1 as
1 you
1 like
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 After
1 settling
1 upon
1 his
1 subject
1 Frank
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 and
1 except
1 that
1 he
1 went
1 out
1 for
1 five
1 minutes
1 to
1 buy
1 and
1 eat
1 a
1 penny
1 loaf
1 continued
1 his
1 work
1 till
1 nightfall
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 came
1 in
1 several
1 times
1 to
1 look
1 at
1 him
1 but
1 each
1 time
1 went
1 out
1 again
1 without
1 making
1 a
1 remark
1 At
1 six
1 o
1 clock
1 Frank
1 laid
1 down
1 his
1 tools
1 I
1 will
1 come
1 again
1 tomorrow
1 sir
1 he
1 said
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 nodded
1 and
1 Frank
1 went
1 home
1 in
1 high
1 spirits
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 prospect
1 at
1 last
1 of
1 getting
1 something
1 to
1 do
1 and
1 that
1 in
1 a
1 line
1 most
1 congenial
1 to
1 his
1 own
1 tastes
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 looked
1 up
1 when
1 he
1 entered
1 next
1 morning
1 I
1 shall
1 not
1 come
1 in
1 today
1 he
1 remarked
1 I
1 will
1 wait
1 to
1 see
1 them
1 finished
1 orking
1 without
1 interruption
1 till
1 the
1 evening
1 Frank
1 finished
1 them
1 to
1 his
1 satisfaction
1 and
1 enveloped
1 them
1 with
1 many
1 wrappings
1 of
1 thread
1 to
1 keep
1 them
1 in
1 precisely
1 the
1 attitudes
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 placed
1 them
1 They
1 are
1 ready
1 for
1 drying
1 now
1 sir
1 he
1 said
1 If
1 I
1 might
1 place
1 them
1 in
1 an
1 oven
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 dried
1 by
1 morning
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 led
1 the
1 way
1 to
1 the
1 kitchen
1 where
1 a
1 small
1 fire
1 was
1 burning
1 I
1 shall
1 put
1 no
1 more
1 coals
1 on
1 the
1 fire
1 he
1 said
1 and
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 out
1 in
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 Put
1 them
1 in
1 there
1 and
1 leave
1 the
1 door
1 open
1 I
1 will
1 close
1 it
1 in
1 an
1 hour
1 when
1 the
1 oven
1 cools
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 Frank
1 was
1 again
1 at
1 work
1 It
1 took
1 him
1 all
1 day
1 to
1 get
1 fur
1 and
1 feather
1 to
1 lie
1 exactly
1 as
1 he
1 wished
1 them
1 In
1 the
1 afternoon
1 he
1 asked
1 the
1 naturalist
1 for
1 a
1 piece
1 of
1 flat
1 board
1 three
1 feet
1 long
1 and
1 a
1 perch
1 but
1 said
1 that
1 instead
1 of
1 the
1 piece
1 of
1 board
1 he
1 should
1 prefer
1 mounting
1 them
1 in
1 a
1 case
1 at
1 once
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 had
1 not
1 one
1 in
1 the
1 shop
1 large
1 enough
1 and
1 therefore
1 Frank
1 arranged
1 his
1 group
1 temporarily
1 on
1 the
1 table
1 On
1 the
1 board
1 lay
1 the
1 cat
1 At
1 first
1 sight
1 she
1 seemed
1 asleep
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 clearly
1 only
1 seeming
1 Her
1 eyes
1 were
1 half
1 open
1 the
1 upper
1 lip
1 was
1 curled
1 up
1 and
1 the
1 sharp
1 teeth
1 showed
1 The
1 hind
1 feet
1 were
1 drawn
1 somewhat
1 under
1 her
1 as
1 in
1 readiness
1 for
1 an
1 instant
1 spring
1 Her
1 front
1 paws
1 were
1 before
1 her
1 the
1 talons
1 were
1 somewhat
1 stretched
1 and
1 one
1 paw
1 was
1 curved
1 Her
1 ears
1 lay
1 slightly
1 back
1 She
1 was
1 evidently
1 on
1 the
1 point
1 of
1 springing
1 The
1 macaw
1 perch
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 cut

1 for

1 I

1 ask
1 to

1 If
1 later
1 on
1 I
1 can
1 as
1 you
1 say
1 do
1 more

1 The
1 old
1 man
1 stood
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 thinking
1 and
1 presently
1 said
1 I
1 do
1 but
1 little
1 except
1 in
1 live
1 stock
1 hen
1 I
1 had
1 my
1 daughter
1 with
1 me
1 I
1 did
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 of
1 stuffing
1 for
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 considerable
1 trade
1 hereabout
1 The
1 sailors
1 bring
1 home
1 skins
1 of
1 foreign
1 birds
1 and
1 want
1 them
1 stuffed
1 and
1 put
1 in
1 cases
1 as
1 presents
1 for
1 their
1 wives
1 and
1 sweethearts
1 You
1 work
1 fast
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 skillfully
1 I
1 have
1 known
1 men
1 who
1 would
1 take
1 a
1 fortnight
1 to
1 do
1 such
1 a
1 group
1 as
1 that
1 and
1 then
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 failure
1 It
1 will
1 be
1 quite
1 a
1 new
1 branch
1 for
1 my
1 trade
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 know
1 how
1 it
1 will
1 act
1 yet
1 but
1 to
1 begin
1 with
1 I
1 will
1 give
1 you
1 twelve
1 shillings
1 a
1 week
1 and
1 a
1 room
1 upstairs
1 If
1 it
1 succeeds
1 we
1 will
1 make
1 other
1 arrangements
1 I
1 am
1 an
1 old
1 man
1 and
1 a
1 very
1 lonely
1 one
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 glad
1 to
1 have
1 such
1 a
1 companion
1 Frank
1 joyfully
1 embraced
1 the
1 offer
1 and
1 ran
1 all
1 the
1 way
1 home
1 to
1 tell
1 his
1 friend
1 the
1 porter
1 of
1 the
1 engagement
1 I
1 am
1 very
1 glad
1 the
1 man
1 said
1 heartily
1 glad
1 I
1 shall
1 miss
1 you
1 sorely
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 know
1 what
1 I
1 should
1 have
1 done
1 without
1 you
1 when
1 I
1 first
1 lost
1 poor
1 Jane
1 and
1 the
1 kids
1 But
1 now
1 I
1 can
1 go
1 back
1 to
1 my
1 old
1 ways
1 again
1 Perhaps
1 Frank
1 suggested
1 you
1 might
1 arrange
1 to
1 have
1 a
1 room
1 also
1 in
1 the
1 house
1 It
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 a
1 very
1 long
1 walk
1 not
1 above
1 twenty
1 or
1 five
1 and
1 twenty
1 minutes
1 and
1 I
1 should
1 be
1 so
1 glad
1 to
1 have
1 you
1 with
1 me
1 The
1 man
1 sat
1 silent
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 No
1 he
1 said
1 at
1 last
1 I
1 thank
1 you
1 all
1 the
1 same
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 it
1 too
1 but
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 best
1 in
1 the
1 end
1 Here
1 all
1 my
1 mates
1 live
1 near
1 and
1 I
1 shall
1 get
1 on
1 in
1 time
1 The
1 Christmas
1 holiday
1 season
1 will
1 soon
1 be
1 coming
1 on
1 and
1 we
1 shall
1 be
1 up
1 working
1 late
1 If
1 you
1 were
1 always
1 going
1 to
1 stop
1 at
1 the
1 place
1 you
1 are
1 going
1 to
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 different
1 but
1 you
1 will
1 rise
1 never
1 fear
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 seeing
1 you
1 in
1 gentleman
1 s
1 clothes
1 again
1 some
1 of
1 these
1 days
1 I
1 ve
1 heard
1 you
1 say
1 you
1 were
1 longing
1 to
1 get
1 your
1 books
1 and
1 to
1 be
1 studying
1 again
1 and
1 you
1 ll
1 soon
1 fall
1 into
1 your
1 own
1 ways
1 but
1 if
1 you
1 will
1 let
1 me
1 I
1 ll
1 come
1 over
1 sometimes
1 and
1 have
1 a
1 cup
1 of
1 tea
1 and
1 a
1 chat
1 with
1 you
1 Now
1 look
1 here
1 I
1 m
1 going
1 out
1 with
1 you
1 now
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 going
1 to
1 buy
1 you
1 a
1 suit
1 of
1 clothes
1 something
1 like
1 what
1 you
1 had
1 on
1 when
1 I
1 first
1 saw
1 you
1 They
1 won
1 t
1 be
1 altogether
1 unsuitable
1 in
1 a
1 shop
1 This
1 is
1 a
1 loan
1 mind
1 and
1 you
1 may
1 pay
1 me
1 off
1 as
1 you
1 get
1 flush
1 Frank
1 saw
1 he
1 should
1 hurt
1 the
1 good
1 fellow
1 s
1 feelings
1 by
1 refusing
1 and
1 accordingly
1 went
1 out
1 with
1 him
1 and
1 next
1 morning
1 presented
1 himself
1 at
1 the
1 shop
1 in
1 a
1 quiet
1 suit
1 of
1 dark
1 gray
1 tweed
1 and
1 with
1 his
1 other
1 clothes
1 in
1 a
1 bundle
1 Aha
1 said
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 you
1 look
1 more
1 as
1 you
1 ought
1 to
1 do
1 now
1 though
1 you
1 re
1 a
1 cut
1 above
1 an
1 assistant
1 in
1 a
1 naturalist
1 s
1 shop
1 in
1 Ratcliff
1 Highway
1 Now
1 let
1 me
1 tell
1 you
1 the
1 names
1 of
1 some
1 of
1 these
1 birds
1 They
1 are
1 every
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 foreigners
1 some
1 of
1 them
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 myself
1 I
1 can
1 tell
1 all
1 the
1 family
1 names
1 Frank
1 said
1 quietly
1 and
1 the
1 species
1 but
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 know
1 the
1 varieties
1 Can
1 you
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 in
1 surprise
1 hat
1 is
1 this
1 now
1 That
1 is
1 a
1 mockingbird
1 the
1 great
1 black
1 capped
1 mockingbird
1 I
1 think
1 The
1 one
1 next
1 to
1 it
1 is
1 a
1 golden
1 lory
1 So
1 Frank
1 went
1 round
1 all
1 the
1 cages
1 and
1 perches
1 in
1 the
1 shop
1 Right
1 in
1 every
1 case
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 enthusiastically
1 I
1 shall
1 have
1 nothing
1 to
1 teach
1 you
1 The
1 sailor
1 has
1 been
1 here
1 this
1 morning
1 I
1 offered
1 him
1 two
1 pounds
1 for
1 the
1 cat
1 and
1 bird
1 to
1 put
1 in
1 my
1 front
1 window
1 but
1 he
1 would
1 not
1 take
1 it
1 and
1 has
1 paid
1 me
1 that
1 sum
1 for
1 your
1 work
1 Here
1 it
1 is
1 This
1 is
1 yours
1 you
1 know
1 You
1 were
1 not
1 in
1 my
1 employment
1 then
1 and
1 you
1 will
1 want
1 some
1 things
1 to
1 start
1 with
1 no
1 doubt
1 Now
1 come
1 upstairs
1 I
1 will
1 show
1 you
1 your
1 room
1 I
1 had
1 intended
1 at
1 first
1 to
1 give
1 you
1 the
1 one
1 at
1 the
1 back
1 but
1 I
1 have
1 decided
1 now
1 on
1 giving
1 you
1 my
1 daughter
1 s
1 I
1 think
1 you
1 will
1 like
1 it
1 Frank
1 did
1 like
1 it
1 greatly
1 It
1 was
1 the
1 front
1 room
1 on
1 the
1 second
1 floor
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 s
1 daughter
1 had
1 evidently
1 been
1 a
1 woman
1 of
1 taste
1 and
1 refinement
1 The
1 room
1 was
1 prettily
1 papered
1 a
1 quiet
1 carpet
1 covered
1 the
1 floor
1 and
1 the
1 furniture
1 was
1 neat
1 and
1 in
1 good
1 keeping
1 Two
1 pairs
1 of
1 spotless
1 muslin
1 curtains
1 hung
1 across
1 the
1 windows
1 I
1 put
1 them
1 up
1 this
1 morning
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 said
1 nodding
1 I
1 have
1 got
1 the
1 sheets
1 and
1 bedding
1 airing
1 in
1 the
1 kitchen
1 They
1 have
1 not
1 been
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 press
1 for
1 the
1 last
1 three
1 years
1 You
1 can
1 cook
1 in
1 the
1 kitchen
1 There
1 is
1 always
1 a
1 fire
1 there
1 Now
1 the
1 first
1 thing
1 to
1 do
1 he
1 went
1 on
1 when
1 they
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 shop
1 will
1 be
1 for
1 you
1 to
1 mount
1 a
1 dozen
1 cases
1 for
1 the
1 windows
1 These
1 drawers
1 are
1 full
1 of
1 skins
1 of
1 birds
1 and
1 small
1 animals
1 I
1 get
1 them
1 for
1 next
1 to
1 nothing
1 from
1 the
1 sailors
1 and
1 sell
1 them
1 to
1 furriers
1 and
1 feather
1 preparers
1 who
1 supply
1 ladies
1 hat
1 and
1 bonnet
1 makers
1 In
1 future
1 I
1 propose
1 that
1 you
1 shall
1 mount
1 them
1 and
1 sell
1 them
1 direct
1 e
1 shall
1 get
1 far
1 higher
1 prices
1 than
1 we
1 do
1 now
1 I
1 seem
1 to
1 be
1 putting
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 work
1 on
1 your
1 shoulders
1 but
1 do
1 not
1 want
1 you
1 to
1 help
1 me
1 in
1 the
1 shop
1 I
1 will
1 look
1 after
1 the
1 birds
1 and
1 buy
1 and
1 sell
1 as
1 I
1 used
1 to
1 do
1 you
1 will
1 have
1 the
1 back
1 room
1 private
1 to
1 yourself
1 for
1 stuffing
1 and
1 mounting
1 Frank
1 was
1 delighted
1 at
1 this
1 allotment
1 of
1 labor
1 and
1 was
1 soon
1 at
1 work
1 rummaging
1 the
1 drawers
1 and
1 picking
1 out
1 specimens
1 for
1 mounting
1 and
1 made
1 a
1 selection
1 sufficient
1 to
1 keep
1 him
1 employed
1 for
1 weeks
1 That
1 evening
1 he
1 sallied
1 out
1 and
1 expended
1 his
1 two
1 pounds
1 in
1 underlinen
1 of
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 sorely
1 in
1 need
1 As
1 he
1 required
1 them
1 his
1 employer
1 ordered
1 showcases
1 for
1 the
1 window
1 of
1 various
1 sizes
1 getting
1 the
1 backgrounds
1 painted
1 and
1 fitted
1 up
1 as
1 Frank
1 suggested
1 Frank
1 did
1 not
1 get
1 on
1 so
1 fast
1 with
1 his
1 work
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 hoped
1 for
1 the
1 fame
1 of
1 the
1 sailor
1 s
1 cat
1 and
1 macaw
1 spread
1 rapidly
1 in
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 perfect
1 rush
1 of
1 sailors
1 and
1 their
1 wives
1 anxious
1 to
1 have
1 birds
1 and
1 skins
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 brought
1 from
1 abroad
1 mounted
1 The
1 sailor
1 himself
1 looked
1 in
1 one
1 day
1 If
1 you
1 like
1 another
1 two
1 pounds
1 for
1 that
1 ere
1 cat
1 governor
1 I
1 m
1 game
1 to
1 pay
1 you
1 It
1 s
1 the
1 best
1 thing
1 that
1 ever
1 happened
1 to
1 me
1 Every
1 one
1 s
1 wanting
1 to
1 see
1 em
1 and
1 there
1 s
1 the
1 old
1 woman
1 dressed
1 up
1 in
1 her
1 Sunday
1 clothes
1 a
1 -sitting
1 in
1 the
1 parlor
1 as
1 proud
1 as
1 a
1 peacock
1 a
1 showing
1 of

1 The
1 house
1 ain
1 t
1 been
1 so
1 quiet
1 since
1 I
1 married
1 Them
1 animals
1 would
1 be
1 cheap
1 to
1 me
1 at
1 a
1 ten
1 pound
1 note
1 They
1 ll
1 get
1 you
1 no
1 end
1 of
1 orders
1 I
1 can
1 tell
1 you
1 The
1 orders
1 indeed
1 came
1 in
1 much
1 faster
1 than
1 Frank
1 could
1 fulfill
1 them
1 although
1 he
1 worked
1 twelve
1 hours
1 a
1 day
1 laying
1 aside
1 all
1 other
1 work
1 however
1 for
1 three
1 hours
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 devote
1 himself
1 to
1 the
1 shop
1 cases
1 which
1 were

1 CHAPTER
1 VII
1 AN
1 OLD
1 FRIEND
1 For
1 three
1 months
1 Frank
1 passed
1 a
1 quiet
1 and
1 not
1 unpleasant
1 life
1 with
1 the
1 old
1 naturalist
1 in
1 Ratcliff
1 Highway
1 The
1 latter
1 took
1 a
1 great
1 liking
1 to
1 him
1 and
1 treated
1 him
1 like
1 a
1 son
1 rather
1 than
1 an
1 assistant
1 The
1 two
1 took
1 their
1 meals
1 together
1 now
1 and
1 Frank
1 s
1 salary
1 had
1 been
1 raised
1 from
1 twelve
1 to
1 eighteen
1 shillings
1 a
1 week
1 So
1 attractive
1 had
1 the
1 cases
1 in
1 the
1 windows
1 proved
1 that
1 quite
1 a
1 little
1 crowd
1 was
1 generally
1 collected
1 round
1 them
1 and
1 the
1 business
1 had
1 greatly
1 augmented
1 The
1 old
1 naturalist
1 was
1 less
1 pleased
1 at
1 this
1 change
1 than
1 most
1 men
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 in
1 his
1 position
1 He
1 had
1 got
1 into
1 a
1 groove
1 and
1 did
1 not
1 care
1 to
1 get
1 out
1 of
1 it
1 He
1 had
1 no
1 relatives
1 or
1 any
1 one
1 dependent
1 on
1 him
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 well
1 content
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 in
1 a
1 jog
1 trot
1 way
1 just
1 paying
1 his
1 expenses
1 of
1 shop
1 and
1 living
1 The
1 extra
1 bustle
1 and
1 push
1 worried
1 rather
1 than
1 pleased
1 him
1 I
1 am
1 an
1 old
1 man
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 one
1 day
1 as
1 after
1 the
1 shop
1 was
1 closed
1 they
1 sat
1 over
1 their
1 tea
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 motive
1 in
1 laying
1 by
1 money
1 and
1 had
1 enough
1 for
1 my
1 wants
1 I
1 was
1 influenced
1 more
1 by
1 my
1 liking
1 for
1 your
1 face
1 and
1 my
1 appreciation
1 of
1 your
1 talent
1 than
1 by
1 any
1 desire
1 of
1 increasing
1 my
1 business
1 I
1 am
1 taking
1 now
1 three
1 times
1 as
1 much
1 as
1 I
1 did
1 before
1 Now
1 I
1 should
1 not
1 mind
1 indeed
1 I
1 should
1 be
1 glad
1 if
1 I
1 thought
1 that
1 you
1 would
1 succeed
1 me
1 here
1 as
1 a
1 son
1 would
1 do
1 I
1 would
1 gladly
1 take
1 you
1 into
1 partnership
1 with
1 me
1 and
1 you
1 would
1 have
1 the
1 whole
1 business
1 after
1 my
1 death
1 But
1 I
1 know
1 my
1 boy
1 that
1 it
1 wouldn
1 t
1 do
1 I
1 know
1 that
1 the
1 time
1 will
1 come
1 when
1 you
1 will
1 not
1 be
1 content
1 with
1 so
1 dull
1 a
1 life
1 here
1 You
1 will
1 either
1 get
1 an
1 offer
1 from
1 some
1 est
1 End
1 house
1 which
1 would
1 open
1 higher
1 prospects
1 to
1 you
1 or
1 you
1 will
1 be
1 wandering
1 away
1 as
1 a
1 collector
1 In
1 any
1 case
1 you
1 would
1 not
1 stop
1 here
1 of
1 that
1 I
1 am
1 quite
1 sure
1 and
1 therefore
1 do
1 not
1 care
1 as
1 I
1 should
1 have
1 done
1 had
1 you
1 been
1 my
1 son
1 for
1 the
1 increase
1 of
1 the
1 business
1 As
1 it
1 is
1 lad
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 even
1 wish
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 waste
1 your
1 life
1 here
1 Frank
1 after
1 he
1 was
1 once
1 fairly
1 settled
1 at
1 his
1 new
1 work
1 had
1 written
1 to
1 his
1 friend
1 the
1 doctor
1 at
1 Deal
1 telling
1 him
1 of
1 the
1 position
1 he
1 had
1 taken
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 in
1 a
1 fair
1 way
1 to
1 make
1 at
1 least
1 a
1 comfortable
1 living
1 and
1 that
1 at
1 a
1 pursuit
1 of
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 passionately
1 fond
1 He
1 asked
1 him
1 however
1 while
1 writing
1 to
1 him
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 to
1 give
1 him
1 news
1 of
1 his
1 sister
1 not
1 to
1 tell
1 any
1 one
1 his
1 address
1 as
1 although
1 he
1 was
1 not
1 ashamed
1 of
1 his
1 berth
1 still
1 he
1 would
1 rather
1 that
1 until
1 he
1 had
1 made
1 another
1 step
1 up
1 in
1 life
1 his
1 old
1 schoolfellows
1 should
1 not
1 know
1 of
1 his
1 whereabouts
1 He
1 had
1 also
1 written
1 to
1 his
1 friend
1 Ruthven
1 a
1 bright
1 chatty
1 letter
1 telling
1 him
1 somewhat
1 of
1 his
1 adventures
1 in
1 London
1 and
1 the
1 loss
1 of
1 his
1 money
1 and
1 saying
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 now
1 got
1 employment
1 at
1 a
1 naturalist
1 s
1 with
1 every
1 chance
1 of
1 making
1 his
1 way
1 hen
1 I
1 mount
1 a
1 bit
1 higher
1 he
1 concluded
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 awfully
1 glad
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 again
1 and
1 will
1 let
1 you
1 know
1 what
1 my
1 address
1 may
1 then
1 be
1 For
1 the
1 present
1 I
1 had
1 rather
1 keep
1 it
1 dark
1 If
1 you
1 will
1 write
1 to
1 me
1 addressed
1 to
1 the
1 General
1 Post
1 Office
1 telling
1 me
1 all
1 about
1 yourself
1 and
1 the
1 fellows
1 at
1 school
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 very
1 very
1 glad
1 to
1 get
1 your
1 letter
1 I
1 suppose
1 you
1 will
1 be
1 breaking
1 up
1 for
1 Christmas
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 days
1 Christmas
1 came
1 and
1 went
1 It
1 was
1 signalized
1 to
1 Frank
1 only
1 by
1 the
1 despatch
1 of
1 a
1 pretty
1 present
1 to
1 Lucy
1 and
1 the
1 receipt
1 of
1 a
1 letter
1 from
1 her
1 written
1 in
1 a
1 round
1 childish
1 hand
1 A
1 week
1 afterwards
1 he
1 heard
1 somebody
1 come
1 into
1 the
1 shop
1 His
1 employer
1 was
1 out
1 and
1 he
1 therefore
1 went
1 into
1 the
1 shop
1 I
1 knew
1 it
1 was
1 shouted
1 a
1 voice
1 My
1 dear
1 old
1 Frank
1 how
1 are
1 you
1 and
1 his
1 hand
1 was
1 warmly
1 clasped
1 in
1 that
1 of
1 Ruthven
1 My
1 dear
1 Ruthven
1 was
1 all
1 Frank
1 could
1 say
1 I
1 had
1 intended
1 Ruthven
1 exclaimed
1 to
1 punch
1 your
1 head
1 directly
1 I
1 found
1 you
1 but
1 I
1 am
1 too
1 glad
1 to
1 do
1 it
1 though
1 you
1 deserve
1 it
1 fifty
1 times
1 over
1 hat
1 a
1 fellow
1 you
1 are
1 I
1 wouldn
1 t
1 have
1 believed
1 it
1 of
1 you
1 running
1 away
1 in
1 that
1 secret
1 sort
1 of
1 way
1 and
1 letting
1 none
1 of
1 us
1 know
1 anything
1 about
1 you
1 asn
1 t
1 I
1 angry
1 and
1 sorry
1 too
1 when
1 I
1 got
1 the
1 letter
1 you
1 wrote
1 me
1 from
1 Deal
1 hen
1 I
1 went
1 back
1 to
1 school
1 and
1 found
1 that
1 not
1 even
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 not
1 even
1 your
1 sister
1 knew
1 where
1 you
1 were
1 I
1 was
1 mad
1 So
1 were
1 all
1 the
1 other
1 fellows
1 However
1 I
1 said
1 I
1 would
1 find
1 you
1 wherever
1 you
1 had
1 hidden
1 yourself
1 But
1 how
1 did
1 you
1 find
1 me
1 Frank
1 asked
1 greatly
1 moved
1 at
1 the
1 warmth
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellow
1 s
1 greeting
1 Oh
1 it
1 wasn
1 t
1 so
1 very
1 difficult
1 to
1 find
1 you
1 when
1 once
1 I
1 got
1 your
1 letter
1 saying
1 what
1 you
1 were
1 doing
1 The
1 very
1 day
1 I
1 came
1 up
1 to
1 town
1 I
1 began
1 to
1 hunt
1 about
1 I
1 found
1 from
1 the
1 Directory
1 there
1 were
1 not
1 such
1 a
1 great
1 number
1 of
1 shops
1 where
1 they
1 stuffed
1 birds
1 and
1 that
1 sort
1 of
1 thing
1 I
1 tried
1 the
1 places
1 in
1 Bond
1 Street
1 and
1 Piccadilly
1 and
1 igmore
1 Street
1 and
1 so
1 on
1 to
1 begin
1 with
1 Then
1 I
1 began
1 to
1 work
1 east
1 and
1 directly
1 I
1 saw
1 the
1 things
1 in
1 the
1 window
1 here
1 I
1 felt
1 sure
1 I
1 had
1 found
1 you
1 at
1 last
1 You
1 tiresome
1 fellow
1 Here
1 I
1 have
1 wasted
1 nearly
1 half
1 my
1 holidays
1 looking
1 for
1 you
1 I
1 am
1 so
1 sorry
1 Ruthven
1 Sorry
1 you
1 ought
1 to
1 be
1 more
1 than
1 sorry
1 You
1 ought
1 to
1 be
1 ashamed
1 of
1 yourself
1 downright
1 ashamed
1 But
1 there
1 I
1 won
1 t
1 say
1 any
1 more
1 now
1 Now
1 can
1 t
1 you
1 come
1 out
1 with
1 me
1 No
1 I
1 can
1 t
1 come
1 out
1 now
1 Ruthven
1 but
1 come
1 into
1 this
1 room
1 with
1 me
1 There
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 hour
1 they
1 chatted
1 Frank
1 giving
1 a
1 full
1 account
1 of
1 all
1 he
1 had
1 gone
1 through
1 since
1 he
1 came
1 up
1 to
1 town
1 while
1 Ruthven
1 gave
1 him
1 the
1 gossip
1 of
1 the
1 half
1 year
1 at
1 school
1 ell
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 at
1 last
1 this
1 old
1 Horton
1 of
1 yours
1 must
1 be
1 a
1 brick
1 Still
1 you
1 know
1 you
1 can
1 t
1 stop
1 here
1 all
1 your
1 life
1 You
1 must
1 come
1 and
1 talk
1 it
1 over
1 with
1 my
1 governor
1 Oh
1 no
1 indeed
1 Ruthven
1 I
1 am
1 getting
1 on
1 very
1 well
1 here
1 and
1 am
1 very
1 contented
1 with
1 my
1 lot
1 and
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 think
1 of
1 troubling
1 your
1 father
1 in
1 the
1 matter
1 ell
1 you
1 will
1 trouble
1 him
1 a
1 great
1 deal
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 if
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 come
1 for
1 you
1 will
1 trouble
1 him
1 to
1 come
1 all
1 the
1 way
1 down
1 here
1 He
1 was
1 quite
1 worried
1 when
1 he
1 first
1 heard
1 of
1 your
1 disappearance
1 and
1 has
1 been
1 almost
1 as
1 excited
1 as
1 I
1 have
1 over
1 the
1 search
1 for
1 you
1 You
1 are
1 really
1 a
1 foolish
1 fellow
1 Frank
1 he
1 went
1 on
1 more
1 seriously
1 I
1 really
1 didn
1 t
1 think
1 it
1 of
1 you
1 Here
1 you
1 save
1 the
1 lives
1 of
1 four
1 or
1 five
1 fellows
1 and
1 put
1 all
1 their
1 friends
1 under
1 a
1 tremendous
1 obligation
1 and
1 then
1 you
1 run
1 away
1 and
1 hide
1 yourself
1 as
1 if
1 you
1 were
1 ashamed
1 I
1 tell
1 you
1 you
1 can
1 t
1 do
1 it
1 A
1 fellow
1 has
1 no
1 more
1 right
1 to
1 get
1 rid
1 of
1 obligations
1 than
1 he
1 has
1 to
1 run
1 away
1 without
1 paying
1 his
1 debts
1 It
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 burden
1 on
1 your
1 mind
1 if
1 you
1 had
1 a
1 heavy
1 debt
1 you
1 couldn
1 t
1 pay
1 and
1 you
1 would
1 have
1 a
1 right
1 to
1 be
1 angry
1 if
1 when
1 you
1 were
1 perfectly
1 able
1 to
1 pay
1 your
1 creditor
1 refused
1 to
1 take
1 the
1 money
1 That
1 s
1 just
1 the
1 position
1 in
1 which
1 you
1 ve
1 placed
1 my
1 father
1 ell
1 anyhow
1 you
1 ve
1 got
1 to
1 come
1 and
1 see
1 him
1 or
1 he
1 s
1 got
1 to
1 come
1 and
1 see
1 you
1 I
1 know
1 he
1 has
1 something
1 in
1 his
1 mind
1 s
1 eye
1 which
1 will
1 just
1 suit
1 you
1 though
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 tell
1 me
1 what
1 it
1 was
1 For
1 the
1 last
1 day
1 or
1 two
1 he
1 has
1 been
1 particularly
1 anxious
1 about
1 finding
1 you
1 Only
1 yesterday
1 when
1 I
1 came
1 back
1 and
1 reported
1 that
1 I
1 had
1 been
1 to
1 half
1 a
1 dozen
1 places
1 without
1 success
1 he
1 said
1 Confound
1 the
1 young
1 rascal
1 where
1 can
1 he
1 be
1 hiding
1 Here
1 are
1 the
1 days
1 slipping
1 by
1 and
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 too
1 late
1 If
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 find
1 him
1 in
1 a
1 day
1 or
1 two
1 Dick
1 I
1 will
1 set
1 the
1 police
1 after
1 him
1 -
1 -say
1 he
1 has
1 committed
1 a
1 murder
1 or
1 broken
1 into
1 a
1 bank
1 and
1 offer
1 a
1 reward
1 for
1 his
1 apprehension
1 So
1 you
1 must
1 either
1 come
1 home
1 with
1 me
1 this
1 afternoon
1 or
1 you
1 will
1 be
1 having
1 my
1 father
1 down
1 here
1 tonight
1 Of
1 course
1 Ruthven
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 would
1 not
1 put
1 your
1 father
1 to
1 such
1 trouble
1 He
1 is
1 very
1 kind
1 to
1 have
1 taken
1 so
1 much
1 interest
1 in
1 me
1 only
1 I
1 hate
1 -
1 -
1 Oh
1 nonsense
1 I
1 hate
1 to
1 see
1 such
1 beastly
1 stuck
1 up
1 pride
1 putting
1 your
1 own
1 dignity
1 above
1 the
1 affection
1 of
1 your
1 friends
1 for
1 that
1 s
1 really
1 what
1 it
1 comes
1 to
1 old
1 boy
1 if
1 you
1 look
1 it
1 fairly
1 in
1 the
1 face
1 Frank
1 flushed
1 a
1 little
1 and
1 was
1 silent
1 for
1 a
1 minute
1 or
1 two
1 I
1 suppose
1 you
1 are
1 right
1 Ruthven
1 but
1 it
1 is
1 a
1 little
1 hard
1 for
1 a
1 fellow
1 -
1 -
1 Oh
1 no
1 it
1 isn
1 t
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 If
1 you
1 d
1 got
1 into
1 a
1 scrape
1 from
1 some
1 fault
1 of
1 your
1 own
1 one
1 could
1 understand
1 it
1 although
1 even
1 then
1 there
1 would
1 be
1 no
1 reason
1 for
1 you
1 to
1 cut
1 your
1 old
1 friends
1 till
1 they
1 cut
1 you
1 Young
1 Goodall
1 who
1 lives
1 over
1 at
1 Bayswater
1 has
1 been
1 over
1 four
1 or
1 five
1 times
1 to
1 ask
1 me
1 if
1 I
1 have
1 succeeded
1 in
1 finding
1 you
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 had
1 letters
1 from

1 and
1 Childers
1 and
1 Jackson
1 Just
1 as
1 if
1 a
1 fellow
1 had
1 got
1 nothing
1 to
1 do
1 but
1 to
1 write
1 letters
1 How
1 long
1 will
1 you
1 be
1 before
1 you
1 can
1 come
1 out
1 There
1 is
1 Mr
1 Horton
1 just
1 come
1 in
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 doubt
1 he
1 will
1 let
1 me
1 go
1 at
1 once
1 The
1 old
1 naturalist
1 at
1 once
1 assented
1 upon
1 Frank
1 s
1 telling
1 him
1 that
1 a
1 friend
1 had
1 come
1 who
1 wished
1 him
1 to
1 go
1 out
1 Certainly
1 my
1 dear
1 boy
1 hy
1 working
1 the
1 hours
1 and
1 hours
1 of
1 overtime
1 that
1 you

1 of
1 course
1 you
1 can
1 take
1 a
1 holiday
1 whenever
1 you
1 re
1 disposed
1 He
1 will
1 not
1 be
1 back
1 till
1 late
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 as
1 they
1 went
1 out
1 I
1 shall
1 keep
1 him
1 all
1 the
1 evening
1 Oh
1 indeed
1 Ruthven
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 clothes
1 Clothes
1 be
1 bothered
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 I
1 certainly
1 shall
1 end
1 by
1 punching
1 your
1 head
1 Frank
1 before
1 the
1 day
1 s
1 out
1 Frank
1 remonstrated
1 no
1 more
1 but
1 committed
1 himself
1 entirely
1 to
1 his
1 friend
1 s
1 guidance
1 At
1 the
1 Mansion
1 House
1 they
1 mounted
1 on
1 the
1 roof
1 of
1 an
1 omnibus
1 going
1 west
1 and
1 at
1 Knightsbridge
1 got
1 off
1 and
1 walked
1 to
1 Eaton
1 Square
1 where
1 Ruthven
1 s
1 father
1 resided
1 The
1 latter
1 was
1 out
1 so
1 Frank
1 accompanied
1 his
1 friend
1 to
1 what
1 he
1 called
1 his
1 sanctum
1 a
1 small
1 room
1 littered
1 up
1 with
1 books
1 bats
1 insect
1 boxes
1 and
1 a
1 great
1 variety
1 of
1 rubbish
1 of
1 all
1 kinds
1 Here
1 they
1 chatted
1 until
1 the
1 servant
1 came
1 up
1 and
1 said
1 that
1 Sir
1 James
1 had
1 returned
1 Come
1 on
1 Frank
1 Ruthven
1 said
1 running
1 downstairs
1 There
1 s
1 nothing
1 of
1 the
1 ogre
1 about
1 the
1 governor
1 They
1 entered
1 the
1 study
1 and
1 Ruthven
1 introduced
1 his
1 friend
1 I
1 ve
1 caught
1 him
1 father
1 at
1 last
1 This
1 is
1 the
1 culprit
1 Sir
1 James
1 Ruthven
1 was
1 a
1 pleasant
1 looking
1 man
1 with
1 a
1 kindly
1 face
1 ell
1 you
1 troublesome
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 holding
1 out
1 his
1 hand
1 where
1 have
1 you
1 been
1 hiding
1 all
1 this
1 time
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 that
1 I
1 ve
1 been
1 hiding
1 sir
1 Frank
1 said
1 Not
1 exactly
1 hiding
1 Sir
1 James
1 smiled
1 only
1 keeping
1 away
1 from
1 those
1 who
1 wanted
1 to
1 find
1 you
1 ell
1 and
1 how
1 are
1 you
1 getting
1 on
1 I
1 am
1 getting
1 on
1 very
1 well
1 sir
1 I
1 am
1 earning
1 eighteen
1 shillings
1 a
1 week
1 and
1 my
1 board
1 and
1 lodging
1 and
1 my
1 employer
1 says
1 he
1 will
1 take
1 me
1 into
1 partnership
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 I
1 come
1 of
1 age
1 Ah
1 indeed
1 Sir
1 James
1 said
1 I
1 am
1 glad
1 to
1 hear
1 that
1 as
1 it
1 shows
1 you
1 must
1 be
1 clever
1 and
1 industrious
1 Yes
1 father
1 and
1 the
1 place
1 was
1 full
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 lovely
1 cases
1 of
1 things
1 Frank
1 had
1 stuffed
1 There
1 was
1 quite
1 a
1 crowd
1 looking
1 in
1 at
1 the
1 window
1 That
1 is
1 very
1 satisfactory
1 Now
1 Frank
1 do
1 you
1 sit
1 down
1 and
1 write
1 a
1 note
1 to
1 your
1 employer
1 asking
1 him
1 to
1 send
1 down
1 half
1 a
1 dozen
1 of
1 the
1 best
1 cases
1 I
1 want
1 to
1 show
1 them
1 to
1 a
1 gentleman
1 who
1 will
1 dine
1 with
1 me
1 here
1 today
1 and
1 who
1 is
1 greatly
1 interested
1 in
1 such
1 matters
1 hen
1 you
1 have
1 written
1 the
1 note
1 I
1 will
1 send
1 a
1 servant
1 off
1 at
1 once
1 in
1 a
1 cab
1 to
1 fetch
1 them
1 And
1 father
1 Dick
1 continued
1 if
1 you
1 don
1 t
1 mind
1 might
1 Frank
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 our
1 dinner
1 quietly
1 together
1 in
1 my
1 room
1 You
1 ve
1 got
1 a
1 dinner
1 party
1 on
1 and
1 Frank
1 won
1 t
1 enjoy
1 it
1 half
1 as
1 much
1 as
1 he
1 would
1 dining
1 quietly
1 with
1 me
1 By
1 all
1 means
1 Sir
1 James
1 said
1 But
1 mind
1 he
1 is
1 not
1 to
1 run
1 away
1 without
1 seeing
1 me
1 You
1 are
1 a
1 foolish
1 lad
1 he
1 went
1 on
1 in
1 a
1 kind
1 voice
1 to
1 Frank
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 wrong
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 foolish
1 to
1 hide
1 yourself
1 from
1 your
1 friends
1 However
1 independent
1 we
1 may
1 be
1 in
1 this
1 world
1 all
1 must
1 to
1 a
1 certain
1 extent
1 rely
1 upon
1 others
1 There
1 is
1 scarcely
1 a
1 man
1 who
1 can
1 stand
1 aloof
1 from
1 the
1 rest
1 and
1 say
1 I
1 want
1 nothing
1 of
1 you
1 I
1 can
1 understand
1 your
1 feeling
1 in
1 shrinking
1 from
1 asking
1 a
1 favor
1 of
1 me
1 or
1 of
1 the
1 fathers
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 boys
1 who
1 are
1 like
1 myself
1 deeply
1 indebted
1 to
1 you
1 for
1 the
1 great
1 service
1 you
1 have
1 rendered
1 their
1 sons
1 I
1 can
1 admire
1 the
1 feeling
1 if
1 not
1 carried
1 too
1 far
1 but
1 you
1 should
1 have
1 let
1 your
1 schoolfellows
1 know
1 exactly
1 how
1 you
1 were
1 placed
1 and
1 so
1 have
1 given
1 us
1 the
1 opportunity
1 of
1 repaying
1 the
1 obligation
1 if
1 we
1 were
1 disposed
1 not
1 to
1 have
1 run
1 away
1 and
1 hidden
1 yourself
1 from
1 us
1 I
1 am
1 sorry
1 sir
1 Frank
1 said
1 simply
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 like
1 to
1 seem
1 to
1 trade
1 upon
1 the
1 slight
1 service
1 I
1 rendered
1 some
1 of
1 my
1 schoolfellows
1 Dr
1 Bateman
1 told
1 me
1 I
1 was
1 wrong
1 but
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 see
1 it
1 then
1 Now
1 I
1 think
1 perhaps
1 he
1 was
1 right
1 although
1 I
1 am
1 afraid
1 that
1 if
1 it
1 happened
1 again
1 I
1 should
1 do
1 the
1 same
1 Sir
1 James
1 smiled
1 I
1 fear
1 you
1 are
1 a
1 stiff
1 necked
1 one
1 Master
1 Frank
1 However
1 I
1 will
1 not
1 scold
1 you
1 any
1 further
1 Now
1 what
1 will
1 you
1 do
1 with
1 yourselves
1 till
1 dinner
1 time
1 Oh
1 we
1 ll
1 just
1 sit
1 and
1 chat
1 father
1 e
1 have
1 got
1 lots
1 more
1 things
1 to
1 tell
1 each
1 other
1 The
1 afternoon
1 passed
1 in
1 pleasant
1 talk
1 Frank
1 learned
1 that
1 Ruthven
1 had
1 now
1 left
1 Dr
1 Parker
1 s
1 for
1 good
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 going
1 down
1 after
1 the
1 holidays
1 to
1 a
1 clergyman
1 who
1 prepared
1 six
1 or
1 eight
1 boys
1 for
1 the
1 army
1 Before
1 dinner
1 the
1 footman
1 returned
1 with
1 half
1 a
1 dozen
1 of
1 the
1 best
1 cases
1 from
1 the
1 shop
1 which
1 were
1 brought
1 up
1 to
1 Dick
1 s
1 room
1 and
1 the
1 latter
1 was
1 delighted
1 with
1 them
1 They
1 greatly
1 enjoyed
1 their
1 dinner
1 together
1 At
1 nine
1 o
1 clock
1 a
1 servant
1 came
1 up
1 and
1 took
1 down
1 the
1 cases
1 Five
1 minutes
1 later
1 he
1 returned
1 again
1 with
1 a
1 message
1 saying
1 that
1 Sir
1 James
1 wished
1 Mr
1 Richard
1 and
1 his
1 friend
1 to
1 go
1 down
1 into
1 the
1 dining
1 room
1 Frank
1 was
1 not
1 shy
1 but
1 he
1 felt
1 it
1 rather
1 a
1 trial
1 when
1 he
1 entered
1 the
1 room
1 where
1 seven
1 or
1 eight
1 gentlemen
1 were
1 sitting
1 round
1 the
1 table
1 the
1 ladies
1 having
1 already
1 withdrawn
1 The
1 gentlemen
1 were
1 engaged
1 in
1 examining
1 and
1 admiring
1 the
1 cases
1 of
1 stuffed
1 birds
1 and
1 animals
1 This
1 is
1 my
1 young
1 friend
1 Sir
1 James
1 said
1 of
1 whom
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 speaking
1 to
1 you
1 and
1 whose
1 work
1 you
1 are
1 all
1 admiring
1 This
1 Frank
1 is
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 the
1 traveler
1 and
1 naturalist
1 of
1 whom
1 you
1 may
1 have
1 heard
1 Yes
1 indeed
1 Frank
1 said
1 looking
1 at
1 the
1 gentleman
1 indicated
1 I
1 have
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 book
1 on
1 The
1 Passerine
1 Family
1 at
1 home
1 It
1 is
1 rather
1 an
1 expensive
1 book
1 too
1 the
1 gentleman
1 said
1 Yes
1 sir
1 My
1 father
1 bought
1 it
1 not
1 I
1 He
1 was
1 very
1 fond
1 of
1 natural
1 history
1 and
1 taught
1 me
1 all
1 I
1 know
1 He
1 had
1 a
1 capital
1 library
1 of
1 books
1 on
1 the
1 subject
1 which
1 Dr
1 Bateman
1 is
1 keeping
1 for
1 me
1 at
1 Deal
1 till
1 I
1 have
1 some
1 place
1 where
1 I
1 can
1 put
1 them
1 I
1 was
1 thinking
1 of
1 getting
1 them
1 up
1 soon
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 asked
1 him
1 a
1 few
1 questions
1 as
1 to
1 the
1 books
1 in
1 the
1 library
1 and
1 then
1 put
1 him
1 through
1 what
1 Frank
1 felt
1 was
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 examination
1 as
1 to
1 his
1 knowledge
1 of
1 their
1 contents
1 Very
1 good
1 indeed
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 from
1 your
1 work
1 here
1 that
1 you
1 are
1 not
1 only
1 a
1 very
1 clever
1 preparer
1 but
1 a
1 close
1 student
1 of
1 the
1 habits
1 and
1 ways
1 of
1 wild
1 creatures
1 But
1 I
1 was
1 hardly
1 prepared
1 to
1 find
1 your
1 scientific
1 knowledge
1 so
1 accurate
1 and
1 extensive
1 I
1 was
1 at
1 first
1 rather
1 inclined
1 to
1 hesitate
1 when
1 Sir
1 James
1 Ruthven
1 made
1 me
1 a
1 proposal
1 just
1 now
1 I
1 do
1 so
1 no
1 longer
1 I
1 am
1 on
1 the
1 point
1 of
1 starting
1 on
1 an
1 expedition
1 into
1 the
1 center
1 of
1 Africa
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 specimens
1 of
1 natural
1 history
1 He
1 has
1 proposed
1 that
1 you
1 should
1 accompany
1 me
1 and
1 has
1 offered
1 to
1 defray
1 the
1 cost
1 of
1 your
1 outfit
1 and
1 of
1 your
1 passage
1 out
1 and
1 home
1 I
1 may
1 be
1 away
1 for
1 two
1 years
1 Of
1 course
1 you
1 would
1 act
1 as
1 my
1 assistant
1 and
1 have
1 every
1 opportunity
1 of
1 acquiring
1 such
1 knowledge
1 as
1 I
1 possess
1 It
1 will
1 be
1 no
1 pleasure
1 trip
1 you
1 know
1 but
1 hard
1 work
1 with
1 all
1 sorts
1 of
1 hardships
1 and
1 perhaps
1 some
1 dangers
1 At
1 the
1 same
1 time
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 fine
1 opening
1 in
1 a
1 career
1 as
1 a
1 naturalist
1 ell
1 what
1 do
1 you
1 say
1 Oh
1 sir
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 clasping
1 his
1 hands
1 it
1 is
1 of
1 all
1 things
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 what
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 most
1 How
1 can
1 I
1 thank
1 you
1 enough
1 And
1 you
1 Sir
1 James
1 it
1 is
1 indeed
1 kind
1 and
1 thoughtful
1 of
1 you
1 e
1 are
1 not
1 quits
1 yet
1 by
1 any
1 means
1 Frank
1 Sir
1 James
1 said
1 kindly
1 I
1 am
1 glad
1 indeed
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 forward
1 your
1 wishes
1 and
1 now
1 you
1 must
1 go
1 upstairs
1 and
1 be
1 introduced
1 to
1 my
1 wife
1 She
1 is
1 most
1 anxious
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 She
1 only
1 returned
1 home
1 just
1 before
1 dinner
1 Frank
1 was
1 taken
1 upstairs
1 where
1 he
1 and
1 his
1 cases
1 of
1 birds
1 were
1 made
1 much
1 of
1 by
1 Lady
1 Ruthven
1 and
1 the
1 ladies
1 assembled
1 in
1 the
1 drawing
1 room
1 He
1 himself
1 was
1 so
1 filled
1 with
1 delight
1 at
1 the
1 prospect
1 opened
1 to
1 him
1 that
1 all
1 thought
1 of
1 his
1 dark
1 tweed
1 suit
1 being
1 out
1 of
1 place
1 among
1 the
1 evening
1 dresses
1 of
1 the
1 ladies
1 and
1 gentlemen
1 which
1 had
1 troubled
1 him
1 while
1 he
1 was
1 awaiting
1 the
1 summons
1 to
1 the
1 dining
1 room
1 quite
1 passed
1 out
1 of
1 his
1 mind
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 do
1 the
1 honors
1 of
1 his
1 cases
1 naturally
1 and
1 without
1 embarrassment
1 At
1 eleven
1 o
1 clock
1 he
1 took
1 his
1 leave
1 promising
1 to
1 call
1 upon
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 who
1 was
1 in
1 lodgings
1 in
1 Jermyn
1 Street
1 upon
1 the
1 following
1 morning
1 that
1 gentleman
1 having
1 at
1 Sir
1 James
1 request
1 undertaken
1 to
1 procure
1 all
1 the
1 necessary
1 outfit
1 I
1 feel
1 really
1 obliged
1 to
1 you
1 Sir
1 James
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 when
1 Frank
1 had
1 left
1 The
1 lad
1 has
1 a
1 genius
1 for
1 natural
1 history
1 and
1 he
1 is
1 modest
1 and
1 self
1 possessed
1 From
1 what
1 you
1 tell
1 me
1 he
1 has
1 done
1 rather
1 than
1 apply
1 for
1 assistance
1 to
1 anyone
1 he
1 must
1 have
1 plenty
1 of
1 pluck
1 and
1 resolution
1 and
1 will
1 make
1 a
1 capital
1 traveling
1 companion
1 I
1 feel
1 quite
1 relieved
1 for
1 it
1 is
1 so
1 difficult
1 to
1 procure
1 a
1 companion
1 who
1 will
1 exactly
1 suit
1 Clever
1 naturalists
1 are
1 rare
1 and
1 one
1 can
1 never
1 tell
1 how
1 one
1 will
1 get
1 on
1 with
1 a
1 man
1 when
1 you
1 are
1 thrown
1 together
1 He
1 may
1 want
1 to
1 have
1 his
1 own
1 way
1 may
1 be
1 irritable
1 and
1 bad
1 tempered
1 may
1 in
1 many
1 respects
1 be
1 a
1 disagreeable
1 companion
1 ith
1 that
1 lad
1 I
1 feel
1 sure
1 of
1 my
1 ground
1 e
1 shall
1 get
1 on
1 capitally
1 together
1 On
1 his
1 return
1 to
1 the
1 shop
1 Frank
1 told
1 his
1 employer
1 whom
1 he
1 found
1 sitting
1 up
1 for
1 him
1 the
1 change
1 which
1 had
1 taken
1 place
1 in
1 his
1 life
1 and
1 the
1 opening
1 which
1 presented
1 itself
1 Mr
1 Horton
1 expressed
1 himself
1 as
1 sincerely
1 glad
1 I
1 shall
1 miss
1 you
1 sadly
1 he
1 said
1 shall
1 feel
1 very
1 dull
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 in
1 my
1 solitary
1 house
1 here
1 but
1 it
1 is
1 better
1 for
1 you
1 that
1 you
1 should
1 go
1 and
1 I
1 never
1 expected
1 to
1 keep
1 you
1 long
1 You
1 were
1 made
1 for
1 better
1 things
1 than
1 this
1 shop
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 doubt
1 that
1 a
1 brilliant
1 career
1 will
1 be
1 open
1 before
1 you
1 You
1 may
1 not
1 become
1 a
1 rich
1 man
1 for
1 natural
1 history
1 is
1 scarcely
1 a
1 lucrative
1 profession
1 but
1 you
1 may
1 become
1 a
1 famous
1 one
1 Now
1 my
1 lad
1 go
1 off
1 to
1 bed
1 and
1 dream
1 of
1 your
1 future
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 Frank
1 went
1 over
1 the
1 first
1 thing
1 after
1 breakfast
1 to
1 see
1 his
1 friend
1 the
1 porter
1 He
1 too
1 was
1 very
1 pleased
1 to
1 hear
1 of
1 Frank
1 s
1 good
1 fortune
1 but
1 he
1 was
1 too
1 busy
1 to
1 talk
1 much
1 to
1 him
1 and
1 promised
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 come
1 over
1 that
1 evening
1 and
1 hear
1 all
1 about
1 it
1 Then
1 Frank
1 took
1 his
1 way
1 to
1 Jermyn
1 Street
1 and
1 went
1 with
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 to
1 Silver
1 s
1 where
1 an
1 outfit
1 suited
1 for
1 the
1 climate
1 of
1 Central
1 Africa
1 was
1 ordered
1 The
1 clothes
1 were
1 simple
1 Shirts
1 made
1 of
1 thin
1 soft
1 flannel
1 knickerbockers
1 and
1 Norfolk
1 jackets
1 of
1 tough
1 New
1 Zealand
1 flax
1 with
1 gaiters
1 of
1 the
1 same
1 material
1 There
1 is
1 nothing
1 like
1 it
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 it
1 is
1 the
1 only
1 stuff
1 which
1 has
1 a
1 chance
1 with
1 the
1 thorns
1 of
1 an
1 African
1 forest
1 Now
1 you
1 will
1 want
1 a
1 revolver
1 a
1 inchester
1 repeating
1 carbine
1 and
1 a
1 shotgun
1 My
1 outfit
1 of
1 boxes
1 and
1 cases
1 is
1 ready
1 so
1 beyond
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 extra
1 nets
1 and
1 collecting
1 boxes
1 there
1 is
1 nothing
1 farther
1 to
1 do
1 in
1 that
1 way
1 For
1 your
1 head
1 you
1 d
1 better
1 have
1 a
1 very
1 soft
1 felt
1 hat
1 with
1 a
1 wide
1 brim
1 with
1 a
1 leaf
1 or
1 two
1 inside
1 they
1 are
1 as
1 cool
1 as
1 anything
1 and
1 are
1 far
1 lighter
1 and
1 more
1 comfortable
1 than
1 the
1 helmets
1 which
1 many
1 people
1 use
1 in
1 the
1 tropics
1 As
1 far
1 as
1 shooting
1 goes
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 think
1 that
1 I
1 shall
1 do
1 much
1 better
1 with
1 my
1 blowgun
1 than
1 with
1 a
1 regular
1 one
1 I
1 can
1 hit
1 a
1 small
1 bird
1 sitting
1 nineteen
1 times
1 out
1 of
1 twenty
1 That
1 is
1 a
1 good
1 thing
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 For
1 shooting
1 sitting
1 there
1 is
1 nothing
1 better
1 than
1 a
1 blowgun
1 in
1 skillful
1 hands
1 They
1 have
1 the
1 advantage
1 too
1 of
1 not
1 breaking
1 the
1 skin
1 but
1 for
1 flying
1 a
1 shotgun
1 is
1 infinitely
1 more
1 accurate
1 You
1 will
1 have
1 little
1 difficulty
1 in
1 learning
1 to
1 shoot
1 well
1 as
1 your
1 eye
1 is
1 already
1 trained
1 by
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 your
1 blowpipe
1 ill
1 you
1 want
1 any
1 knives
1 for
1 skinning
1 No
1 sir
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 plentiful
1 stock
1 of
1 them
1 Are
1 you
1 going
1 back
1 to
1 Eaton
1 Square
1 I
1 heard
1 Sir
1 James
1 ask
1 you
1 to
1 stop
1 there
1 until
1 we
1 start
1 No
1 Frank
1 replied
1 I
1 asked
1 his
1 permission
1 to
1 stay
1 where
1 I
1 am
1 till
1 tomorrow
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 like
1 to
1 seem
1 in
1 a
1 hurry
1 to
1 run
1 away
1 from
1 Mr
1 Horton
1 who
1 has
1 been
1 extremely
1 kind
1 to
1 me
1 Mind
1 you
1 must
1 come
1 here
1 in
1 three
1 days
1 to
1 have
1 your
1 things
1 tried
1 on
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 I
1 particularly
1 ordered
1 that
1 they
1 are
1 to
1 be
1 made
1 easy
1 and
1 comfortable
1 larger
1 indeed
1 than
1 you
1 absolutely
1 require
1 but
1 we
1 must
1 allow
1 for
1 growing
1 and
1 two
1 years
1 may
1 make
1 a
1 difference
1 of
1 some
1 inches
1 to
1 you
1 Now
1 we
1 have
1 only
1 to
1 go
1 to
1 a
1 bootmaker
1 s
1 and
1 then
1 we
1 have
1 done
1 hen
1 the
1 orders
1 were
1 completed
1 they
1 separated
1 as
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 was
1 going
1 down
1 that
1 afternoon
1 to
1 the
1 country
1 and
1 was
1 not
1 to
1 return
1 until
1 the
1 day
1 preceding
1 that
1 on
1 which
1 they
1 were
1 to
1 sail
1 That
1 evening
1 Frank
1 had
1 a
1 long
1 chat
1 with
1 his
1 two
1 friends
1 and
1 was
1 much
1 pleased
1 when
1 the
1 old
1 naturalist
1 who
1 had
1 taken
1 a
1 great
1 fancy
1 to
1 the
1 honest
1 porter
1 offered
1 him
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 a
1 room
1 at
1 his
1 house
1 saying
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 be
1 more
1 than
1 paid
1 by
1 the
1 pleasure
1 of
1 his
1 company
1 of
1 an
1 evening
1 The
1 offer
1 was
1 accepted
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 glad
1 to
1 think
1 that
1 his
1 two
1 friends
1 would
1 be
1 sitting
1 smoking
1 their
1 pipes
1 together
1 of
1 an
1 evening
1 instead
1 of
1 being
1 in
1 their
1 solitary
1 rooms
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 he
1 took
1 up
1 his
1 residence
1 in
1 Eaton
1 square
1 CHAPTER
1 VIII
1 TO
1 THE
1 DARK
1 CONTINENT
1 After
1 spending
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 days
1 going
1 about
1 London
1 and
1 enjoying
1 himself
1 with
1 his
1 friend
1 Dick
1 Frank
1 started
1 for
1 Deal
1 where
1 he
1 was
1 pleased
1 to
1 find
1 his
1 sister
1 well
1 and
1 happy
1 He
1 bade
1 goodbye
1 to
1 her
1 to
1 the
1 doctor
1 and
1 such
1 of
1 his
1 schoolfellows
1 as
1 lived
1 in
1 Deal
1 to
1 whom
1 his
1 start
1 for
1 Central
1 Africa
1 was
1 quite
1 an
1 event
1 Dr
1 Bateman
1 handed
1 over
1 to
1 him
1 his
1 watch
1 and
1 chain
1 and
1 his
1 blowgun
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 taken
1 care
1 of
1 for
1 him
1 also
1 his
1 skinning
1 knives
1 and
1 instruments
1 The
1 same
1 evening
1 he
1 returned
1 to
1 town
1 and
1 spent
1 the
1 days
1 very
1 pleasantly
1 until
1 the
1 afternoon
1 came
1 when
1 he
1 was
1 to
1 depart
1 Then
1 he
1 bade
1 farewell
1 to
1 his
1 kind
1 friends
1 Sir
1 James
1 and
1 Lady
1 Ruthven
1 Dick
1 accompanied
1 him
1 in
1 the
1 cab
1 to
1 Euston
1 station
1 where
1 a
1 minute
1 or
1 two
1 later
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 arrived
1 The
1 luggage
1 was
1 placed
1 in
1 a
1 carriage
1 and
1 Frank
1 stood
1 chatting
1 with
1 Dick
1 at
1 the
1 door
1 until
1 the
1 guard
1 s
1 cry
1 Take
1 your
1 places
1 caused
1 him
1 to
1 jump
1 into
1 the
1 carriage
1 There
1 was
1 one
1 more
1 hearty
1 handshake
1 with
1 his
1 friend
1 and
1 then
1 the
1 train
1 steamed
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 station
1 It
1 was
1 midnight
1 when
1 they
1 arrived
1 at
1 Liverpool
1 and
1 at
1 once
1 went
1 to
1 bed
1 at
1 the
1 Station
1 Hotel
1 On
1 coming
1 down
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 Frank
1 was
1 astonished
1 at
1 the
1 huge
1 heap
1 of
1 baggage
1 piled
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 hall
1 but
1 he
1 was
1 told
1 that
1 this
1 was
1 of
1 daily
1 occurrence
1 as
1 six
1 or
1 eight
1 large
1 steamers
1 went
1 out
1 from
1 Liverpool
1 every
1 week
1 for
1 America
1 alone
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 great
1 proportion
1 of
1 the
1 passengers
1 came
1 down
1 as
1 they
1 had
1 done
1 on
1 the
1 previous
1 night
1 and
1 slept
1 at
1 the
1 Station
1 hotel
1 Their
1 own
1 share
1 of
1 the
1 baggage
1 was
1 not
1 large
1 consisting
1 only
1 of
1 a
1 portmanteau
1 each
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 having
1 sent
1 down
1 all
1 his
1 boxes
1 two
1 days
1 previously
1 At
1 twelve
1 o
1 clock
1 they
1 went
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 Niger
1 bound
1 for
1 the
1 west
1 coast
1 of
1 Africa
1 This
1 would
1 carry
1 them
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 whence
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 intended
1 to
1 take
1 passage
1 in
1 a
1 sailing
1 ship
1 to
1 his
1 starting
1 point
1 for
1 the
1 interior
1 Frank
1 enjoyed
1 the
1 voyage
1 out
1 intensely
1 and
1 three
1 days
1 after
1 sailing
1 they
1 had
1 left
1 winter
1 behind
1 four
1 days
1 later
1 they
1 were
1 lying
1 in
1 the
1 harbor
1 of
1 Funchal
1 hat
1 a
1 glorious
1 place
1 that
1 would
1 be
1 to
1 ramble
1 about
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Yes
1 indeed
1 It
1 would
1 be
1 difficult
1 to
1 imagine
1 a
1 greater
1 contrast
1 than
1 between
1 this
1 mountainous
1 island
1 of
1 Madeira
1 and
1 the
1 country
1 which
1 we
1 are
1 about
1 to
1 penetrate
1 This
1 is
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 delightful
1 climates
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 the
1 west
1 coast
1 of
1 Africa
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 worst
1 Once
1 well
1 in
1 the
1 interior
1 the
1 swamp
1 fevers
1 which
1 are
1 the
1 curse
1 of
1 the
1 shores
1 disappear
1 but
1 African
1 travelers
1 are
1 seldom
1 long
1 free
1 from
1 attacks
1 of
1 fever
1 of
1 one
1 kind
1 or
1 the
1 other
1 However
1 quinine
1 does
1 wonders
1 and
1 we
1 shall
1 be
1 far
1 in
1 the
1 interior
1 before
1 the
1 bad
1 season
1 comes
1 on
1 You
1 have
1 been
1 there
1 before
1 you
1 said
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Yes
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 there
1 twice
1 and
1 have
1 made
1 excursions
1 for
1 short
1 distances
1 from
1 the
1 coast
1 But
1 this
1 time
1 we
1 are
1 going
1 into
1 a
1 country
1 which
1 may
1 be
1 said
1 to
1 be
1 altogether
1 unknown
1 One
1 or
1 two
1 explorers
1 have
1 made
1 their
1 way
1 there
1 but
1 these
1 have
1 done
1 little
1 towards
1 examining
1 the
1 natural
1 productions
1 of
1 the
1 country
1 and
1 have
1 been
1 rather
1 led
1 by
1 inducements
1 of
1 sport
1 than
1 by
1 those
1 of
1 research
1 Did
1 you
1 have
1 fever
1 sir
1 Two
1 or
1 three
1 little
1 attacks
1 A
1 touch
1 of
1 African
1 fever
1 during
1 what
1 is
1 called
1 the
1 good
1 season
1 is
1 of
1 little
1 more
1 importance
1 than
1 a
1 feverish
1 cold
1 at
1 home
1 It
1 lasts
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 days
1 and
1 then
1 there
1 is
1 an
1 end
1 of
1 it
1 In
1 the
1 bad
1 season
1 the
1 attacks
1 are
1 extremely
1 violent
1 sometimes
1 carrying
1 men
1 off
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 hours
1 I
1 consider
1 however
1 that
1 dysentery
1 is
1 a
1 more
1 formidable
1 enemy
1 than
1 fever
1 However
1 even
1 that
1 when
1 properly
1 treated
1 should
1 be
1 combated
1 successfully
1 Do
1 you
1 mean
1 to
1 hire
1 the
1 men
1 to
1 go
1 with
1 you
1 at
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 Certainly
1 not
1 Frank
1 The
1 negroes
1 of
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 are
1 the
1 most
1 indolent
1 the
1 most
1 worthless
1 and
1 the
1 most
1 insolent
1 in
1 all
1 Africa
1 It
1 is
1 the
1 last
1 place
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 at
1 which
1 to
1 hire
1 followers
1 e
1 must
1 get
1 them
1 at
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 itself
1 and
1 at
1 each
1 place
1 we
1 arrive
1 at
1 afterwards
1 we
1 take
1 on
1 others
1 merely
1 retaining
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 old
1 lot
1 to
1 act
1 as
1 interpreter
1 The
1 natives
1 although
1 they
1 may
1 allow
1 white
1 men
1 to
1 pass
1 safely
1 are
1 exceedingly
1 jealous
1 of
1 men
1 of
1 other
1 tribes
1 I
1 shall
1 however
1 take
1 with
1 me
1 if
1 possible
1 a
1 body
1 of
1 say
1 six
1 Houssas
1 who
1 are
1 the
1 best
1 fighting
1 negroes
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 These
1 I
1 shall
1 take
1 as
1 a
1 bodyguard
1 the
1 carriers
1 we
1 shall
1 obtain
1 from
1 the
1 different
1 tribes
1 we
1 visit
1 The
1 Kroomen
1 whom
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 at
1 Cape
1 Palmas
1 are
1 a
1 magnificent
1 set
1 of
1 men
1 They
1 furnish
1 sailors
1 and
1 boatmen
1 to
1 all
1 the
1 ships
1 trading
1 on
1 these
1 shores
1 They
1 are
1 strong
1 willing
1 and
1 faithful
1 but
1 they
1 do
1 not
1 like
1 going
1 up
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 Now
1 we
1 will
1 land
1 here
1 and
1 get
1 a
1 few
1 hours
1 run
1 on
1 shore
1 There
1 are
1 one
1 or
1 two
1 peculiarities
1 about
1 Madeira
1 which

1 To
1 begin
1 with
1 we

1 go
1 for
1 a
1 ride
1 in
1 a
1 bullock
1 cart
1 without
1 wheels
1 But
1 surely
1 it
1 must
1 jolt
1 about
1 terribly
1 Frank
1 said
1 Not
1 at
1 all
1 The
1 roads
1 are
1 paved
1 with
1 round
1 knubbly
1 stones
1 such
1 as
1 you
1 see
1 sometimes
1 in
1 narrow
1 lanes
1 and
1 courts
1 in
1 seaside
1 places
1 at
1 home
1 These
1 would
1 not
1 make
1 smooth
1 roads
1 for
1 wheeled
1 vehicles
1 but
1 here
1 as
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 the
1 carts
1 are
1 placed
1 on
1 long
1 runners
1 like
1 those
1 of
1 sledges
1 These
1 are
1 greased
1 and
1 the
1 driver
1 always
1 has
1 a
1 pound
1 of
1 candles
1 or
1 so
1 hanging
1 to
1 the
1 cart
1 hen
1 he
1 thinks
1 that
1 the
1 runners
1 want
1 greasing
1 he
1 takes
1 a
1 candle
1 lays
1 it
1 down
1 on
1 the
1 road
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 runners
1 and
1 lets
1 this
1 pass
1 over
1 it
1 This
1 greases
1 it
1 sufficiently
1 and
1 it
1 glides
1 along
1 over
1 the
1 stones
1 almost
1 as
1 smoothly
1 as
1 if
1 passing
1 over
1 ice
1 Frank
1 thoroughly
1 enjoyed
1 his
1 run
1 on
1 shore
1 but
1 was
1 surprised
1 at
1 the
1 air
1 of
1 listlessness
1 which
1 pervaded
1 the
1 inhabitants
1 Every
1 one
1 moved
1 about
1 in
1 the
1 most
1 dawdling
1 fashion
1 The
1 shopkeepers
1 looked
1 out
1 from
1 their
1 doors
1 as
1 if
1 it
1 were
1 a
1 matter
1 of
1 perfect
1 indifference
1 to
1 them
1 whether
1 customers
1 called
1 or
1 not
1 The
1 few
1 soldiers
1 in
1 Portuguese
1 uniform
1 looked
1 as
1 if
1 they
1 had
1 never
1 done
1 a
1 day
1 s
1 drill
1 since
1 they
1 left
1 home
1 Groups
1 sat
1 in
1 chairs
1 under
1 the
1 trees
1 and
1 sipped
1 cooling
1 drinks
1 or
1 coffee
1 The
1 very
1 bullocks
1 which
1 drew
1 the
1 gliding
1 wagons
1 seemed
1 to
1 move
1 more
1 slowly
1 than
1 bullocks
1 in
1 other
1 places
1 Frank
1 and
1 his
1 friend
1 drove
1 in
1 a
1 wagon
1 to
1 the
1 monastery
1 high
1 up
1 on
1 the
1 mountain
1 and
1 then
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 on
1 a
1 little
1 hand
1 sledge
1 which
1 was
1 drawn
1 by
1 two
1 men
1 with
1 ropes
1 who
1 took
1 them
1 down
1 the
1 sharp
1 descent
1 at
1 a
1 run
1 dashing
1 round
1 corners
1 at
1 a
1 pace
1 which
1 made
1 Frank
1 hold
1 his
1 breath
1 It
1 took
1 them
1 but
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 to
1 regain
1 the
1 town
1 while
1 an
1 hour
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 had
1 been
1 occupied
1 in
1 the
1 journey
1 out
1 I
1 shall
1 buy
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 hammocks
1 here
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 They
1 are
1 made
1 of
1 knotted
1 string
1 and
1 are
1 lighter
1 and
1 more
1 comfortable
1 than
1 those
1 to
1 be
1 met
1 with
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 I
1 will
1 get
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 their
1 cane
1 chairs
1 too
1 they
1 are
1 very
1 light
1 and
1 comfortable
1 In
1 the
1 afternoon
1 they
1 again
1 embarked
1 and
1 then
1 steamed
1 away
1 for
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 After
1 several
1 days
1 passage
1 they
1 arrived
1 there
1 at
1 daylight
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 soon
1 on
1 deck
1 hat
1 a
1 beautiful
1 place
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 It
1 is
1 not
1 a
1 bit
1 what
1 I
1 expected
1 No
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 no
1 one
1 looking
1 at
1 it
1 could
1 suppose
1 that
1 bright
1 pretty
1 town
1 had
1 earned
1 for
1 itself
1 the
1 name
1 of
1 the
1 white

1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 is
1 built
1 on
1 a
1 somewhat
1 steep
1 ascent
1 about
1 a
1 mile
1 up
1 the
1 river
1 Freetown
1 as
1 the
1 capital
1 is
1 properly
1 called
1 stands
1 some
1 fifty
1 feet
1 or
1 so
1 above
1 the
1 sea
1 and
1 the
1 barracks
1 upon
1 a
1 green
1 hill
1 three
1 hundred
1 feet
1 above
1 it
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 a
1 mile
1 back
1 The
1 town
1 as
1 seen
1 from
1 the
1 sea
1 consists
1 entirely
1 of
1 the
1 houses
1 of
1 the
1 merchants
1 and
1 shopkeepers
1 the
1 government
1 buildings
1 churches
1 and
1 other
1 public
1 and
1 European
1 buildings
1 The
1 houses
1 are
1 all
1 large
1 and
1 bright
1 with
1 yellow
1 tinged
1 whitewash
1 and
1 the
1 place
1 is
1 completely
1 embowered
1 in
1 palms
1 and
1 other
1 tropical
1 trees
1 The
1 native
1 town
1 lies
1 hidden
1 from
1 sight
1 among
1 trees
1 on
1 low
1 ground
1 to
1 the
1 left
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 Everywhere
1 around
1 the
1 town
1 the
1 hills
1 rise
1 steep
1 and
1 high
1 wooded
1 to
1 the
1 summit
1 Altogether
1 there
1 are
1 few
1 more
1 prettily
1 situated
1 towns
1 than
1 the
1 capital
1 of
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 It
1 is
1 wonderful
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 that
1 generations
1 and
1 generations
1 of
1 Europeans
1 have
1 been
1 content
1 to
1 live
1 and
1 die
1 in
1 that
1 wretchedly
1 unhealthy
1 place
1 when
1 they
1 might
1 have
1 established
1 themselves
1 on
1 those
1 lofty
1 hills
1 but
1 a
1 mile
1 away
1 There
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 far
1 above
1 the
1 malarious
1 mists
1 which
1 rise
1 from
1 the
1 low
1 ground
1 The
1 walk
1 up
1 and
1 down
1 to
1 their
1 warehouses
1 and
1 offices
1 here
1 would
1 be
1 good
1 for
1 them
1 and
1 there
1 is
1 no
1 reason
1 why
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 should
1 be
1 an
1 unhealthy
1 residence
1 Unfortunately
1 the
1 European
1 in
1 Africa
1 speedily
1 loses
1 his
1 vigor
1 and
1 enterprise
1 hen
1 he
1 first
1 lands
1 he
1 exclaims
1 I
1 certainly
1 shall
1 have
1 a
1 bungalow
1 built
1 upon
1 those
1 hills
1 but
1 in
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 his
1 energy
1 leaves
1 him
1 He
1 falls
1 into
1 the
1 ways
1 of
1 the
1 place

1 a
1 great
1 deal
1 more
1 spirits
1 than
1 is

1 down
1 near
1 the
1 water
1 and
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 a
1 year
1 or
1 so
1 if
1 he
1 lives
1 so
1 long
1 is
1 obliged
1 to
1 go
1 back
1 to
1 Europe
1 to
1 recruit
1 Look
1 at
1 the
1 boats
1 coming
1 out
1 A
1 score
1 of
1 boats
1 each
1 containing
1 from
1 ten
1 to
1 twelve
1 men
1 approached
1 the
1 ship
1 They
1 remained
1 at
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 until
1 the
1 harbor
1 master
1 came
1 on
1 board
1 and
1 pronounced
1 the
1 ship
1 free
1 from
1 quarantine
1 Then
1 the
1 boats
1 made
1 a
1 rush
1 to
1 the
1 side
1 and
1 with
1 shouts
1 yells
1 and
1 screams
1 of
1 laughter
1 scrambled
1 on
1 board
1 Frank
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 astonished
1 and
1 amused
1 at
1 the
1 noise
1 and
1 confusion
1 hat
1 on
1 earth
1 do
1 they
1 all
1 want
1 he
1 asked
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 The
1 great
1 proportion
1 of
1 them
1 don
1 t
1 want
1 anything
1 at
1 all
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 but
1 have
1 merely
1 come
1 off
1 for
1 amusement
1 Some
1 of
1 them
1 come
1 to
1 be
1 hired
1 some
1 to
1 carry
1 luggage
1 others
1 to
1 tout
1 for
1 the
1 boatmen
1 below
1 Look
1 at
1 those
1 respectable
1 negresses
1 coming
1 up
1 the
1 gangway
1 now
1 They
1 are
1 washerwomen
1 and
1 will
1 take
1 our
1 clothes
1 ashore
1 and
1 bring
1 them
1 on
1 board
1 again
1 this
1 afternoon
1 before
1 we
1 start
1 It
1 seems
1 running
1 rather
1 a
1 risk
1 Frank
1 said
1 No
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 they
1 all
1 have
1 testimonials
1 and
1 I
1 believe
1 it
1 is
1 perfectly
1 safe
1 to
1 intrust
1 things
1 to
1 them
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 now
1 prepared
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 shore
1 but
1 this
1 was
1 not
1 easily
1 accomplished
1 for
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 battle
1 royal
1 among
1 the
1 boatmen
1 whose
1 craft
1 thronged
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 ladder
1 Each
1 boat
1 had
1 about
1 four
1 hands
1 three
1 of
1 whom
1 remained
1 on
1 board
1 her
1 while
1 the
1 fourth
1 stood
1 upon
1 the
1 ladder
1 and
1 hauled
1 at
1 the
1 painter
1 to
1 keep
1 the
1 boat
1 to
1 which
1 he
1 belonged
1 alongside
1 As
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 twenty
1 boats
1 lying
1 there
1 not
1 more
1 than
1 two
1 could
1 be
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 ladder
1 together
1 the
1 conflict
1 was
1 a
1 desperate
1 one
1 All
1 the
1 boatmen
1 shouted
1 Here
1 sar
1 This
1 good
1 boat
1 sar
1 You
1 come
1 wid
1 me
1 sar
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 their
1 voices
1 while
1 at
1 the
1 same
1 time
1 they
1 were
1 hard
1 at
1 work
1 pulling
1 each
1 other
1 s
1 boats
1 back
1 and
1 pushing
1 their
1 own
1 forward
1 So
1 great
1 was
1 the
1 struggle
1 as
1 Frank
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 approached
1 the
1 gangway
1 so
1 great
1 the
1 crowd
1 upon
1 the
1 ladder
1 that
1 one
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 iron
1 bar
1 from
1 which
1 the
1 ladder
1 chains
1 depend
1 broke
1 in
1 two
1 causing
1 the
1 ladder
1 to
1 drop
1 some
1 inches
1 and
1 giving
1 a
1 ducking
1 to
1 those
1 on
1 the
1 lower
1 step
1 causing
1 shouts
1 of
1 laughter
1 and
1 confusion
1 These
1 rose
1 into
1 perfect
1 yells
1 of
1 amusement
1 when
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 sailors
1 suddenly
1 loosed
1 the
1 ladder
1 rope
1 letting
1 five
1 or
1 six
1 of
1 the
1 negroes
1 into
1 the
1 water
1 up
1 to
1 their
1 necks
1 So
1 intense
1 was
1 the
1 appreciation
1 by
1 the
1 sable
1 mind
1 of
1 this
1 joke
1 that
1 the
1 boatmen
1 rolled
1 about
1 with
1 laughter
1 and
1 even
1 the
1 victims
1 when
1 they
1 had
1 once
1 scrambled
1 into
1 their
1 boats
1 yelled
1 like
1 people
1 possessed
1 They
1 are
1 just
1 like
1 children
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 They
1 are
1 always
1 either
1 laughing
1 or
1 quarreling
1 They
1 are
1 good
1 natured
1 and
1 passionate
1 indolent
1 but
1 will
1 work
1 hard
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 clever
1 up
1 to
1 a
1 certain
1 point
1 densely
1 stupid
1 beyond
1 The
1 intelligence
1 of
1 an
1 average
1 negro
1 is
1 about
1 equal
1 to
1 that
1 of
1 a
1 European
1 child
1 of
1 ten
1 years
1 old
1 A
1 few
1 a
1 very
1 few
1 go
1 beyond
1 this
1 but
1 these
1 are
1 exceptions
1 just
1 as
1 Shakespeare
1 was
1 an
1 exception
1 to
1 the
1 ordinary
1 intellect
1 of
1 an
1 Englishman
1 They
1 are
1 fluent
1 talkers
1 but
1 their
1 ideas
1 are
1 borrowed
1 They
1 are
1 absolutely
1 without
1 originality
1 absolutely
1 without
1 inventive
1 power
1 Living
1 among
1 white
1 men
1 their
1 imitative
1 faculties
1 enable
1 them
1 to
1 attain
1 a
1 considerable
1 amount
1 of
1 civilization
1 Left
1 alone
1 to
1 their
1 own
1 devices
1 they
1 retrograde
1 into
1 a
1 state
1 little
1 above
1 their
1 native
1 savagery
1 This
1 was
1 said
1 as
1 after
1 having
1 fixed
1 upon
1 a
1 boat
1 and
1 literally
1 fought
1 their
1 way
1 into
1 it
1 they
1 were
1 rowed
1 towards
1 the
1 shore
1 On
1 landing
1 Frank
1 was
1 delighted
1 with
1 the
1 greenness
1 of
1 everything
1 The
1 trees
1 were
1 heavy
1 with
1 luxuriant
1 foliage
1 the
1 streets
1 were
1 green
1 with
1 grass
1 as
1 long
1 and
1 bright
1 as
1 that
1 in
1 a
1 country
1 lane
1 in
1 England
1 The
1 hill
1 on
1 which
1 the
1 barracks
1 stand
1 was
1 as
1 bright
1 a
1 green
1 as
1 you
1 would
1 see
1 on
1 English
1 slopes
1 after
1 a
1 wet
1 April
1 while
1 down
1 the
1 streets
1 clear
1 streams
1 were
1 running
1 The
1 town
1 was
1 alive
1 with
1 a
1 chattering
1 laughing
1 good
1 natured
1 excitable
1 population
1 all
1 black
1 but
1 with
1 some
1 slight
1 variation
1 in
1 the
1 dinginess
1 of
1 the
1 hue
1 Never
1 was
1 there
1 such
1 a
1 place
1 for
1 fun
1 as
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 Every
1 one
1 was
1 brimful
1 of
1 it
1 Every
1 one
1 laughed
1 when
1 he
1 or
1 she
1 spoke
1 and
1 every
1 one
1 standing
1 near
1 joined
1 freely
1 in
1 the
1 conversation
1 and
1 laughed
1 too
1 Frank
1 was
1 delighted
1 with
1 the
1 display
1 of
1 fruit
1 in
1 the
1 market
1 which
1 is
1 probably
1 unequaled
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 Great
1 piles
1 there
1 were
1 of
1 delicious
1 big
1 oranges
1 green
1 but
1 perfectly
1 sweet
1 and
1 of
1 equally
1 refreshing
1 little
1 green
1 limes
1 pineapples
1 and
1 bananas
1 green
1 yellow
1 and
1 red
1 guava
1 and
1 custard
1 apples
1 alligator
1 pears
1 melons
1 and
1 sour
1 sops
1 and
1 many
1 other
1 native
1 fruits
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 purchased
1 a
1 large
1 basket
1 of
1 fruit
1 which
1 they
1 took
1 with
1 them
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 ship
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 they
1 started
1 down
1 the
1 coast
1 They
1 passed
1 Liberia
1 the
1 republic
1 formed
1 of
1 liberated
1 slaves
1 and
1 of
1 negroes
1 from
1 America
1 and
1 brought
1 up
1 a
1 mile
1 or
1 two
1 off
1 Monrovia
1 its
1 capital
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 they
1 anchored
1 off
1 Cape
1 Palmas
1 the
1 headquarters
1 of
1 the
1 Kroomen
1 A
1 number
1 of
1 these
1 men
1 came
1 off
1 in
1 their
1 canoes
1 and
1 caused
1 great
1 amusement

1 by
1 their
1 fun
1 and
1 dexterity
1 in
1 the
1 management
1 of
1 their
1 little
1 craft
1 These
1 boats
1 are
1 extremely
1 light
1 being
1 hollowed
1 out
1 until
1 little
1 thicker
1 than
1 pasteboard
1 and
1 even
1 with
1 two
1 Kroomen
1 paddling
1 it
1 is
1 difficult
1 for
1 a
1 European
1 to
1 sit
1 in
1 them
1 so
1 extremely
1 crank
1 are
1 they
1 Light

1 take
1 time
1 but
1 in
1 the
1 hurry
1 and
1 excitement
1 of
1 diving
1 for
1 coppers
1 when
1 half
1 a
1 dozen
1 men
1 would
1 leap
1 overboard
1 together
1 the
1 canoes
1 were
1 frequently
1 capsized
1 The
1 divers
1 however
1 thought
1 nothing
1 of
1 these
1 mishaps
1 righting
1 the
1 boats
1 and
1 getting
1 in
1 again
1 without
1 difficulty
1 Splendidly
1 muscular
1 fellows
1 they
1 were
1 Indeed
1 except
1 among
1 the
1 Turkish
1 hamals
1 it
1 is
1 doubtful
1 whether
1 such
1 powerful
1 figures
1 could
1 be
1 found
1 elsewhere
1 They
1 would
1 be
1 grand
1 fellows
1 to
1 take
1 with
1 us
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Frank
1 said
1 Yes
1 if
1 they
1 were
1 as
1 plucky
1 as
1 they
1 are
1 strong
1 one
1 could
1 wish
1 for
1 nothing
1 better
1 but
1 they
1 are
1 notorious
1 cowards
1 and
1 no
1 offer
1 would
1 tempt
1 them
1 to
1 penetrate
1 into
1 such
1 a
1 country
1 as
1 that
1 into
1 which
1 we
1 are
1 going
1 Stopping
1 a
1 few
1 hours
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 Castle
1 Accra
1 and
1 other
1 ports
1 they
1 at
1 last
1 arrived
1 at
1 Bonny
1 It
1 is
1 not
1 tempting
1 in
1 appearance
1 Frank
1 said
1 certainly
1 No
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 replied
1 this
1 is
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 horribly
1 unhealthy
1 spots
1 in
1 Africa
1 As
1 you
1 see
1 the
1 white
1 traders
1 do
1 not
1 dare
1 to
1 live
1 on
1 shore
1 but
1 take
1 up
1 their
1 residence
1 in
1 those
1 old
1 floating
1 hulks
1 which
1 are
1 thatched
1 over
1 and
1 serve
1 as
1 residences
1 and
1 storehouses
1 I
1 have
1 a
1 letter
1 from
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 African
1 merchants
1 in
1 London
1 and
1 we
1 shall
1 take
1 up
1 our
1 abode
1 on
1 board
1 his
1 hulk
1 until
1 we
1 get
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 coasting
1 steamers
1 to
1 carry
1 us
1 down
1 I
1 hope
1 it
1 will
1 not
1 be
1 many
1 days
1 The
1 very
1 bulky
1 luggage
1 was
1 soon
1 transferred
1 to
1 the
1 hulk
1 where
1 Frank
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 took
1 up
1 their
1 residence
1 The
1 agent
1 in
1 charge
1 was
1 very
1 glad
1 to
1 receive
1 them
1 as
1 any
1 break
1 in
1 the
1 terrible
1 monotony
1 of
1 such
1 a
1 life
1 is
1 eagerly
1 welcomed
1 He
1 was
1 a
1 pale
1 unhealthy
1 looking
1 man
1 and
1 had
1 just
1 recovered
1 from
1 an
1 unusually
1 bad
1 attack
1 of
1 fever
1 Like
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 traders
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 he
1 had
1 an
1 immense
1 faith
1 in
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 spirits
1 It
1 is
1 the
1 ruin
1 of
1 them
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 when
1 they
1 were
1 alone
1 Five
1 out
1 of
1 six
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 here
1 ruin
1 their
1 constitutions
1 with
1 spirits
1 and
1 then
1 fall
1 an
1 easy
1 prey
1 to
1 the
1 fever
1 But
1 you
1 have
1 brought
1 spirits
1 with
1 you
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 I
1 saw
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 cases
1 were
1 labeled
1 Brandy
1 Brandy
1 is
1 useful
1 when
1 taken
1 as
1 a
1 medicine
1 and
1 in
1 moderation
1 A
1 little
1 mixed
1 with
1 water
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 a
1 long
1 day
1 of
1 exhausting
1 work
1 acts
1 as
1 a
1 restorative
1 and
1 frequently
1 enables
1 a
1 worn
1 out
1 man
1 to
1 sleep
1 But
1 I
1 have
1 brought
1 the
1 brandy
1 you
1 see
1 for
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 others
1 rather
1 than
1 myself
1 One
1 case
1 is
1 of
1 the
1 very
1 best
1 spirits
1 for
1 our
1 own
1 use
1 The
1 rest
1 is
1 common
1 stuff
1 and
1 is
1 intended
1 as
1 presents
1 Our
1 main
1 drink
1 will
1 be
1 tea
1 and
1 chocolate
1 These
1 are
1 invaluable
1 for
1 the
1 traveler
1 I
1 have
1 besides
1 large
1 quantities
1 of
1 calico
1 brass
1 stair
1 rods
1 beads
1 and
1 powder
1 These
1 are
1 the
1 money
1 of
1 Africa
1 and
1 pass
1 current
1 everywhere
1 ith
1 these
1 we
1 shall
1 pay
1 our
1 carriers
1 and
1 boatmen
1 with
1 these
1 purchase
1 the
1 right
1 of
1 way
1 through
1 the
1 various
1 tribes
1 we
1 shall
1 meet
1 Moreover
1 it
1 is
1 almost
1 necessary
1 in
1 Africa
1 to
1 pass
1 as
1 traders
1 The
1 people
1 perfectly
1 understand
1 that
1 white
1 men
1 come
1 here
1 to
1 trade
1 but
1 if
1 we
1 said
1 that
1 our
1 object
1 was
1 to
1 shoot
1 birds
1 and
1 beasts
1 and
1 to
1 catch
1 butterflies
1 and
1 insects
1 they
1 would
1 not
1 believe
1 us
1 in
1 the
1 slightest
1 degree
1 but
1 would
1 suspect
1 us
1 of
1 all
1 sorts
1 of
1 hidden
1 designs
1 Now
1 we
1 will
1 go
1 ashore
1 and
1 pay
1 our
1 respects
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 Do
1 you
1 mean
1 to
1 say
1 that
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 king
1 in
1 that
1 wretched
1 looking
1 village
1 Frank
1 asked
1 in
1 surprise
1 Kings
1 are
1 as
1 plentiful
1 as
1 peas
1 in
1 Africa
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 but
1 you
1 will
1 not
1 see
1 much
1 royal
1 state
1 Frank
1 was
1 disappointed
1 indeed
1 upon
1 landing
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 had
1 given
1 him
1 an
1 exalted
1 idea
1 of
1 African
1 civilization
1 but
1 this
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 dispelled
1 by
1 the
1 appearance
1 of
1 Bonny
1 The
1 houses
1 were
1 constructed
1 entirely
1 of
1 black
1 mud
1 and
1 the
1 streets
1 were
1 narrow
1 and
1 filthy
1 beyond
1 description
1 The
1 palace
1 was
1 composed
1 of
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 hovels
1 surrounded
1 by
1 a
1 mud
1 wall
1 In
1 one
1 of
1 these
1 huts
1 the
1 king
1 was
1 seated
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 were
1 introduced
1 by
1 the
1 agent
1 who
1 had
1 gone
1 ashore
1 with
1 them
1 and
1 His
1 Majesty
1 who
1 was
1 an
1 almost
1 naked
1 negro
1 at
1 once
1 invited
1 them
1 to
1 join
1 him
1 in
1 the
1 meal
1 of
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 partaking
1 As
1 a
1 matter
1 of
1 courtesy
1 they
1 consented
1 and
1 plates
1 were
1 placed
1 before
1 them
1 heaped
1 with
1 a
1 stew
1 consisting
1 of
1 meat
1 vegetables
1 and
1 hot
1 peppers
1 hile
1 the
1 meal
1 went
1 on
1 the
1 king
1 asked
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 what
1 he
1 had
1 come
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 for
1 and
1 was
1 disappointed
1 to
1 find
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 not
1 going
1 to
1 set
1 up
1 as
1 a
1 trader
1 at
1 Bonny
1 as
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 custom
1 for
1 each
1 newcomer
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 handsome
1 present
1 to
1 him
1 hen
1 the
1 meal
1 was
1 over
1 they
1 took
1 their
1 leave
1 Do
1 you
1 know
1 what
1 you
1 have
1 been
1 eating
1 the
1 agent
1 asked
1 Frank
1 Not
1 in
1 the
1 least
1 Frank
1 said
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 bad
1 what
1 was
1 it
1 It
1 was
1 dog
1 flesh
1 the
1 agent
1 answered
1 Not
1 really
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 with
1 an
1 uncomfortable
1 sensation
1 of
1 sickness
1 Yes
1 indeed
1 the
1 agent
1 replied
1 Dog
1 s
1 meat
1 is
1 considered
1 a
1 luxury
1 in
1 Bonny
1 and
1 dogs
1 are
1 bred
1 specially
1 for
1 the
1 table
1 You
1 ll
1 eat
1 stranger
1 things
1 than
1 that
1 before
1 you
1 ve
1 done
1 Frank
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 continued
1 and
1 will
1 find
1 them
1 just
1 as
1 good
1 and
1 in
1 many
1 cases
1 better
1 than
1 those
1 to
1 which
1 you
1 are
1 accustomed
1 It
1 is
1 a
1 strange
1 thing
1 why
1 in
1 Europe
1 certain
1 animals
1 should
1 be
1 considered
1 fit
1 to
1 eat
1 and
1 certain
1 animals
1 altogether
1 rejected
1 and
1 this
1 without
1 the
1 slightest
1 reason
1 Horses
1 and
1 donkeys
1 are
1 as
1 clean
1 feeders
1 as
1 oxen
1 and
1 sheep
1 Dogs
1 cats
1 and
1 rats
1 are
1 far
1 cleaner
1 than
1 pigs
1 and
1 ducks
1 The
1 flesh
1 of
1 the
1 one
1 set
1 is
1 every
1 bit
1 as
1 good
1 as
1 that
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 and
1 yet
1 the
1 poorest
1 peasant
1 would
1 turn
1 up
1 his
1 nose
1 at
1 them
1 Here
1 sheep
1 and
1 oxen
1 horses
1 and
1 donkeys
1 will
1 not
1 live
1 and
1 the
1 natives
1 very
1 wisely
1 make
1 the
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 animals
1 which
1 can
1 do
1 so
1 Frank
1 was
1 soon
1 tired
1 of
1 Bonny
1 and
1 was
1 glad
1 to
1 hear
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 start
1 the
1 next
1 day
1 for
1 Fernando
1 Po
1 in
1 a
1 little
1 steamer
1 called
1 the
1 Retriever
1 The
1 island
1 of
1 Fernando
1 Po
1 is
1 a
1 very
1 beautiful
1 one
1 the
1 peak
1 rising
1 ten
1 thousand
1 feet
1 above
1 the
1 sea
1 and
1 wooded
1 to
1 the
1 very
1 summit
1 ere
1 the
1 trees
1 to
1 some
1 extent
1 cleared
1 away
1 the
1 island
1 might
1 be
1 very
1 healthy
1 As
1 it
1 is
1 it
1 is
1 little
1 better
1 than
1 the
1 mainland
1 There
1 was
1 not
1 much
1 to
1 see
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 of
1 Clarence
1 whose
1 population
1 consists
1 entirely
1 of
1 traders
1 from
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 Kroomen
1 etc
1 The
1 natives
1 whose
1 tribal
1 name
1 is
1 Adiza
1 live
1 in
1 little
1 villages
1 in
1 the
1 interior
1 They
1 are
1 an
1 extremely
1 primitive
1 people
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 most
1 part
1 dispense
1 altogether
1 with
1 clothing
1 The
1 island
1 belongs
1 to
1 Spain
1 and
1 is
1 used
1 as
1 a
1 prison
1 the
1 convicts
1 being
1 kept
1 in
1 guard
1 ships
1 in
1 the
1 harbor
1 After
1 a
1 stay
1 of
1 three
1 days
1 there
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 took
1 passage
1 in
1 a
1 sailing
1 ship
1 for
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 CHAPTER
1 IX
1 THE
1 START
1 INLAND
1 After
1 the
1 comforts
1 of
1 a
1 fine
1 steamer
1 the
1 accommodation
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 little
1 trader
1 was
1 poor
1 indeed
1 The
1 vessel
1 smelt
1 horribly
1 of
1 palm
1 oil
1 and
1 was
1 alive
1 with
1 cockroaches
1 These
1 however
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 cared
1 little
1 for
1 as
1 they
1 brought
1 up
1 their
1 mattresses
1 and
1 slept
1 on
1 deck
1 Upon
1 their
1 voyage
1 out
1 from
1 England
1 Frank
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 several
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 passengers
1 had
1 amused
1 himself
1 by
1 practicing
1 with
1 his
1 rifle
1 at
1 empty
1 bottles
1 thrown
1 overboard
1 and
1 other
1 objects
1 and
1 having
1 nothing
1 else
1 to
1 do
1 now
1 he
1 resumed
1 the
1 practice
1 accustoming
1 himself
1 also
1 to
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 his
1 revolver
1 the
1 mark
1 being
1 a
1 small
1 log
1 of
1 wood
1 swung
1 from
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 a
1 yard
1 I
1 told
1 you
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 that
1 your
1 skill
1 with
1 the
1 blowgun
1 would
1 prove
1 useful
1 to
1 you
1 in
1 shooting
1 You
1 are
1 as
1 good
1 a
1 shot
1 as
1 I
1 am
1 and
1 I
1 am
1 considered
1 a
1 fair
1 one
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 doubt
1 that
1 with
1 a
1 little
1 practice
1 you
1 will
1 succeed
1 as
1 well
1 with
1 your
1 double
1 barrel
1 The
1 shooting
1 of
1 birds
1 on
1 the
1 wing
1 is
1 a
1 knack
1 which
1 seems
1 to
1 come
1 naturally
1 to
1 some
1 people
1 while
1 others
1 practice
1 as
1 they
1 will
1 never
1 become
1 good
1 shots
1 The
1 ship
1 touched
1 twice
1 upon
1 its
1 way
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 Once
1 at
1 the
1 Malimba
1 river
1 the
1 second
1 time
1 at
1 Botauga
1 the
1 latter
1 being
1 the
1 principal
1 ivory
1 port
1 in
1 equatorial
1 Africa
1 Shall
1 we
1 meet
1 with
1 any
1 elephants
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 Frank
1 asked
1 his
1 friend
1 In
1 all
1 probability
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 Elephant
1 shooting
1 of
1 course
1 does
1 not
1 come
1 within
1 our
1 line
1 of
1 action
1 and
1 I
1 should
1 not
1 go
1 at
1 all
1 out
1 of
1 my
1 way
1 for
1 them
1 Still
1 if
1 we
1 meet
1 them
1 we
1 will
1 shoot
1 them
1 The
1 ivory
1 is
1 valuable
1 and
1 will
1 help
1 to
1 pay
1 our
1 expenses
1 while
1 the
1 meat
1 is
1 much
1 prized
1 by
1 the
1 natives
1 who
1 will
1 gladly
1 assist
1 us
1 in
1 consideration
1 of
1 the
1 flesh
1 On
1 the
1 sixteenth
1 day
1 after
1 leaving
1 Fernando
1 Po
1 they
1 entered
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 On
1 the

1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 at
1 once
1 landed
1 and
1 made
1 inquiries
1 for
1 a
1 house
1 He
1 succeeded
1 in
1 finding
1 one
1 consisting
1 of
1 three
1 rooms
1 built
1 on
1 piles
1 an
1 important
1 point
1 in
1 a
1 country
1 in
1 which
1 disease
1 rises
1 from
1 the
1 soil
1 At
1 Bonny
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 with
1 the
1 assistance
1 of
1 the
1 agent
1 enlisted
1 six
1 Houssas
1 These
1 people
1 live
1 much
1 higher
1 up
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 but
1 they
1 wander
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 and
1 may
1 be
1 met
1 with
1 in
1 most
1 of
1 the
1 ports
1 The
1 men
1 had
1 formed
1 a
1 guard
1 in
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 hulks
1 but
1 trade
1 having
1 been
1 bad
1 the
1 agent
1 had
1 gone
1 home
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 glad
1 to
1 take
1 service
1 with
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 They
1 spoke
1 a
1 few
1 words
1 of
1 English
1 and
1 like
1 the
1 Kroomen
1 rejoiced
1 in
1 names
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 given
1 them
1 by
1 sailors
1 They
1 were
1 called
1 Moses
1 Firewater
1 Ugly
1 Tom
1 Bacon
1 Tatters
1 and
1 King
1 John
1 They
1 were
1 now
1 for
1 the
1 first
1 time
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 and
1 the
1 goods
1 were
1 soon
1 transported
1 from
1 the
1 brig
1 to
1 the
1 house
1 Is
1 anything
1 the
1 matter
1 with
1 you
1 Frank
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 asked
1 that
1 evening
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 sir
1 My
1 head
1 feels
1 heavy
1 somehow
1 and
1 I
1 am
1 giddy
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 felt
1 his
1 pulse
1 You
1 have
1 got
1 your
1 first
1 touch
1 of
1 fever
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 wonder
1 you
1 ve
1 been
1 so
1 long
1 without
1 it
1 You
1 had
1 better
1 lie
1 down
1 at
1 once
1 A
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 afterwards
1 Frank
1 was
1 seized
1 with
1 an
1 overpowering
1 heat
1 every
1 vein
1 appearing
1 to
1 be
1 filled
1 with
1 liquid
1 fire
1 but
1 his
1 skin
1 instead
1 of
1 being
1 as
1 usual
1 in
1 a
1 state
1 of
1 perspiration
1 was
1 dry
1 and
1 hard
1 Now
1 Frank
1 sit
1 up
1 and
1 drink
1 this
1 It
1 s
1 only
1 some
1 mustard
1 and
1 salt
1 and
1 water
1 I
1 have
1 immense
1 faith
1 in
1 an
1 emetic
1 The
1 draught
1 soon
1 took
1 its
1 effect
1 Frank
1 was
1 violently
1 sick
1 and
1 the
1 perspiration
1 broke
1 in
1 streams
1 from
1 him
1 Here
1 is
1 a
1 cup
1 of
1 tea
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 drink
1 that
1 and
1 you
1 will
1 find
1 that
1 there
1 will
1 be
1 little
1 the
1 matter
1 with
1 you
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 Frank
1 awoke
1 feeling
1 weak
1 but
1 otherwise
1 perfectly
1 well
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 administered
1 a
1 strong
1 dose
1 of
1 quinine
1 and
1 after
1 he
1 had
1 had
1 his
1 breakfast
1 he
1 felt
1 quite
1 himself
1 again
1 Now
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 we
1 will
1 go
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 factories
1 and
1 mission
1 and
1 try
1 and
1 find
1 a
1 really
1 good
1 servant
1 Everything
1 depends
1 upon
1 that
1 In
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 an
1 engagement
1 was
1 made
1 with
1 a
1 negro
1 of
1 the
1 name
1 of
1 Ostik
1 He
1 was
1 a
1 Mpongwe
1 man
1 that
1 being
1 the
1 name
1 of
1 the
1 tribe
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 He
1 spoke
1 English
1 fairly
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 languages
1 He
1 had
1 before
1 made
1 a
1 journey
1 some
1 distance
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 with
1 a
1 white
1 traveler
1 He
1 was
1 a
1 tall
1 and
1 powerfully
1 built
1 negro
1 very
1 ugly
1 but
1 with
1 a
1 pleasant
1 and
1 honest
1 face
1 Frank
1 felt
1 at
1 once
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 like
1 him
1 You
1 quite
1 understand
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 explained
1 we
1 are
1 going
1 through
1 the
1 Fan
1 country
1 far
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 e
1 may
1 be
1 away
1 from
1 the
1 coast
1 for
1 many
1 months
1 Me
1 ready
1 sar
1 the
1 man
1 answered
1 with
1 a
1 grin
1 Mak
1 no
1 odds
1 to
1 Ostik
1 He
1 got
1 no
1 wife
1 no
1 piccanniny
1 Ostik
1 very
1 good
1 cook
1 Master
1 find
1 good
1 grub
1 he
1 catch
1 plenty
1 of
1 beasts
1 You
1 re
1 not
1 afraid
1 Ostik
1 because
1 it
1 is
1 possible
1 we
1 may
1 have
1 trouble
1 on
1 the
1 way
1 Me
1 not
1 very
1 much
1 afraid
1 massa
1 You
1 good
1 massa
1 to
1 Ostik
1 he
1 no
1 run
1 away
1 if
1 fightee
1 come
1 but
1 no
1 good
1 fight
1 whole
1 tribe
1 I
1 hope
1 not
1 to
1 have
1 any
1 fighting
1 at
1 all
1 Ostik
1 but
1 as
1 I
1 have
1 got
1 six
1 Houssas
1 with
1 me
1 who
1 will
1 all
1 carry
1 breech
1 loading
1 guns
1 I
1 think
1 we
1 should
1 be
1 a
1 match
1 for
1 a
1 good
1 sized
1 tribe
1 if
1 necessary
1 Ostik
1 looked
1 thoughtful
1 More
1 easy
1 massa
1 go
1 without
1 Houssas
1 he
1 said
1 Black
1 man
1 not
1 often
1 touch
1 white
1 traveler
1 No
1 Ostik
1 that
1 is
1 true
1 but
1 I
1 must
1 take
1 with
1 me
1 trade
1 goods
1 for
1 paying
1 my
1 way
1 and
1 hiring
1 carriers
1 and
1 if
1 alone
1 I
1 should
1 be
1 at
1 the
1 mercy
1 of
1 every
1 petty
1 chief
1 who
1 chose
1 to
1 plunder
1 and
1 delay
1 me
1 I
1 am
1 going
1 as
1 a
1 peaceful
1 traveler
1 ready
1 to
1 pay
1 my
1 way
1 and
1 to
1 make
1 presents
1 to
1 the
1 different
1 kings
1 through
1 whose
1 territories
1 I
1 may
1 pass
1 But
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 choose
1 to
1 put
1 myself
1 at
1 the
1 mercy
1 of
1 any
1 of
1 them
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 say
1 that
1 eight
1 men
1 armed
1 with
1 breech
1 loaders
1 could
1 defeat
1 a
1 whole
1 tribe
1 but
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 so
1 formidable
1 that
1 any
1 of
1 these
1 negro
1 kings
1 would
1 probably
1 prefer
1 taking
1 presents
1 and
1 letting
1 us
1 pass
1 peacefully
1 to
1 trying
1 to
1 rob
1 us
1 The
1 first
1 thing
1 to
1 do
1 will
1 be
1 to
1 hire
1 one
1 large
1 canoe
1 or
1 two
1 if
1 necessary
1 The
1 men
1 must
1 agree
1 to
1 take
1 us
1 up
1 into
1 the
1 Fan
1 country
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 the
1 rapids
1 on
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 Then
1 we
1 shall
1 take
1 carriers
1 there
1 and
1 the
1 boat
1 can
1 return
1 by
1 itself
1 These
1 are
1 the
1 things
1 which
1 will
1 have
1 to
1 go
1 The
1 baggage
1 consisted
1 of
1 ten
1 large
1 tin
1 cases
1 each
1 weighing
1 about
1 eighty
1 pounds
1 These
1 contained
1 cotton
1 cloths
1 powder
1 beads
1 tea
1 chocolate
1 sugar
1 and
1 biscuits
1 There
1 were
1 in
1 addition
1 three
1 bundles
1 of
1 stair
1 rods
1 each
1 about
1 the
1 same
1 weight
1 as
1 the
1 boxes
1 These
1 were
1 done
1 up
1 in
1 canvas
1 There
1 was
1 also
1 a
1 tent
1 made
1 of
1 double
1 canvas
1 weighing
1 fifty
1 pounds
1 and
1 two
1 light
1 folding
1 tressel
1 beds
1 weighing
1 fifteen
1 pounds
1 apiece
1 Thus
1 fourteen
1 men
1 would
1 be
1 required
1 as
1 carriers
1 besides
1 some
1 for
1 plantains
1 and
1 other
1 provisions
1 together
1 with
1 the
1 portmanteaus
1 rugs
1 and
1 waterproof
1 sheets
1 of
1 the
1 travelers
1 There
1 were
1 besides
1 six
1 great
1 chests
1 made
1 of
1 light
1 iron
1 Four
1 of
1 these
1 were
1 fitted
1 with
1 trays
1 with
1 cork
1 bottoms
1 for
1 insects
1 The
1 other
1 two
1 were
1 for
1 the
1 skins
1 of
1 birds
1 All
1 the
1 boxes
1 and
1 cases
1 had
1 strips
1 of
1 India
1 rubber
1 where
1 the
1 lids
1 fitted
1 down
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 keep
1 out
1 both
1 damp
1 and
1 the
1 tiny
1 ants
1 which
1 are
1 the
1 plague
1 of
1 naturalists
1 in
1 Africa
1 Four
1 or
1 five
1 days
1 were
1 occupied
1 in
1 getting
1 together
1 a
1 crew
1 for
1 the
1 natives
1 had
1 an
1 abject
1 fear
1 of
1 entering
1 the
1 country
1 of
1 the
1 cannibal
1 Fans
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 promised
1 that
1 they
1 should
1 not
1 be
1 obliged
1 to
1 proceed
1 unless
1 a
1 safe
1 conduct
1 for
1 their
1 return
1 was
1 obtained
1 from
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 A
1 large
1 canoe
1 was
1 procured
1 sufficient
1 to
1 convey
1 the
1 whole
1 party
1 Twelve
1 paddlers
1 were
1 hired
1 and
1 the
1 goods
1 taken
1 down
1 and
1 arranged
1 in
1 the
1 boat
1 The
1 Houssas
1 had
1 been
1 on
1 landing
1 furnished
1 with
1 their
1 guns
1 which
1 were
1 Snider
1 rifles
1 had
1 been
1 instructed
1 in
1 the
1 breech
1 loading
1 arrangement
1 and
1 had
1 been
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 to
1 practice
1 at
1 a
1 mark
1 at
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 fifty
1 yards
1 distance
1 -
1 -the
1 stump
1 of
1 an
1 old
1 tree
1 some
1 five
1 feet
1 in
1 height
1 serving
1 for
1 the
1 purpose
1 The
1 men
1 were
1 delighted
1 with
1 the
1 accuracy
1 of
1 their
1 pieces
1 and
1 the
1 rapidity
1 at
1 which
1 they
1 could
1 be
1 fired
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 impressed
1 upon
1 them
1 that
1 unless
1 attacked
1 at
1 close
1 quarters
1 and
1 specially
1 ordered
1 to
1 fire
1 fast
1 they
1 must
1 aim
1 just
1 as
1 slowly
1 and
1 deliberately
1 as
1 if
1 using
1 their
1 old
1 guns
1 for
1 that
1 in
1 so
1 long
1 a
1 journey
1 ammunition
1 would
1 be
1 precious
1 and
1 must
1 therefore
1 on
1 no
1 account
1 whatever
1 be
1 wasted
1 In
1 the
1 boxes
1 were
1 six
1 thousand
1 rounds
1 of
1 ammunition
1 a
1 thousand
1 for
1 each
1 gun
1 besides
1 the
1 ammunition
1 for
1 the
1 rifles
1 and
1 fowling
1 pieces
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 In
1 order
1 to
1 render
1 the
1 appearance
1 of
1 his
1 followers
1 as
1 imposing
1 as
1 possible
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 furnished
1 each
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 with
1 a
1 pair
1 of
1 trousers
1 made
1 of
1 New
1 Zealand
1 flax
1 reaching
1 to
1 their
1 knees
1 These
1 he
1 had
1 brought
1 from
1 England
1 with
1 him
1 They
1 were
1 all
1 found
1 to
1 be
1 too
1 large
1 but
1 the
1 men
1 soon
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 with
1 rough
1 needles
1 and
1 thread
1 and
1 took
1 them
1 in
1 In
1 addition
1 to
1 these
1 each
1 man
1 was
1 furnished
1 with
1 a
1 red
1 sash
1 which
1 went
1 several
1 times
1 round
1 the
1 waist
1 and
1 served
1 to
1 keep
1 the
1 trousers
1 up
1 and
1 to
1 give
1 a
1 gay
1 aspect
1 to
1 the
1 dress
1 The
1 Houssas
1 were
1 much
1 pleased
1 with
1 their
1 appearance
1 All
1 of
1 them
1 carried
1 swords
1 in
1 addition
1 to
1 the
1 guns
1 as
1 in
1 their
1 own
1 country
1 they
1 are
1 accustomed
1 to
1 fight
1 with
1 these
1 weapons
1 They
1 started
1 early
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 and
1 after
1 four
1 hours
1 paddling
1 passed
1 Konig
1 Island
1 an
1 abandoned
1 Dutch
1 settlement
1 Here
1 they
1 stopped
1 for
1 an
1 hour
1 or
1 two
1 and
1 then
1 the
1 sea
1 breeze
1 sprang
1 up
1 a
1 sail
1 was
1 hoisted
1 and
1 late
1 at
1 night
1 they
1 passed
1 a
1 French
1 guardship
1 placed
1 to
1 mark
1 the
1 boundary
1 of
1 that
1 settlement
1 at
1 a
1 point
1 where
1 a
1 large
1 tributary
1 called
1 the
1 Boqui
1 runs
1 into
1 it
1 Here
1 is
1 a
1 little
1 island
1 called
1 Nenge
1 Nenge
1 formerly
1 a
1 missionary
1 station
1 where
1 the
1 natives
1 are
1 still
1 Christians
1 At
1 this
1 place
1 the
1 canoe
1 was
1 hauled
1 ashore
1 The
1 Houssas
1 had
1 already
1 been
1 instructed
1 in
1 the
1 method
1 of
1 pitching
1 the
1 tent
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 very
1 few
1 minutes
1 this
1 was
1 erected
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 double
1 poled
1 tent
1 some
1 ten
1 feet
1 square
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 waterproof
1 sheet
1 large
1 enough
1 to
1 cover
1 the
1 whole
1 of
1 the
1 interior
1 thus
1 preventing
1 the
1 miasma
1 from
1 arising
1 from
1 the
1 ground
1 within
1 it
1 The
1 beds
1 were
1 soon
1 opened
1 and
1 fixed
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 large
1 cases
1 formed
1 a
1 table
1 and
1 two
1 smaller
1 ones
1 did
1 service
1 as
1 chairs
1 A
1 lamp
1 was
1 lit
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 charmed
1 with
1 the
1 comfort
1 and
1 snugness
1 of
1 the
1 abode
1 The
1 men
1 s
1 weapons
1 were
1 fastened
1 round
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 poles
1 to
1 keep
1 them
1 from
1 the
1 damp
1 night
1 air
1 Ostik
1 had
1 at
1 once
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 on
1 landing
1 leaving
1 the
1 Houssas
1 to
1 pitch
1 the
1 tent
1 A
1 fire
1 was
1 soon
1 blazing
1 and
1 a
1 kettle
1 and
1 saucepans
1 suspended
1 over
1 it
1 Rice
1 was
1 served
1 out
1 to
1 the
1 men
1 with
1 the
1 addition
1 of
1 some
1 salt
1 meat
1 of
1 which
1 sufficient
1 had
1 been
1 purchased
1 from
1 the
1 captain
1 of
1 the
1 brig
1 to
1 last
1 throughout
1 the
1 journey
1 in
1 the
1 canoe
1 The
1 men
1 were
1 all
1 in
1 high
1 spirits
1 at
1 this
1 addition
1 to
1 their
1 fare
1 which
1 was
1 more
1 than
1 had
1 been
1 bargained
1 for
1 and
1 their
1 songs
1 rose
1 merrily
1 round
1 the
1 fire
1 in
1 the
1 night
1 air
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 after
1 breakfast
1 they
1 again
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 in
1 the
1 canoe
1 For
1 twelve
1 miles
1 they
1 paddled
1 the
1 tide
1 at
1 first
1 assisting
1 them
1 but
1 after
1 this
1 the
1 water
1 from
1 the
1 mountains
1 ahead
1 overpowered
1 it
1 Presently
1 they
1 arrived
1 at
1 the
1 first
1 Fan
1 village
1 called
1 Olenga
1 which
1 they
1 reached
1 six
1 hours
1 after
1 starting
1 The
1 natives
1 crowded
1 round
1 as
1 the
1 canoe
1 approached
1 full
1 of
1 curiosity
1 and
1 excitement
1 for
1 never
1 but
1 once
1 had
1 a
1 white
1 man
1 passed
1 up
1 the
1 river
1 These
1 Fans
1 differed
1 widely
1 from
1 the
1 coast
1 negroes
1 Their
1 hair
1 was
1 longer
1 and
1 thicker
1 their
1 figures
1 were
1 slight
1 their
1 complexion
1 coffee
1 colored
1 and
1 their
1 projecting
1 upper
1 jaws
1 gave
1 them
1 a
1 rabbit
1 mouthed
1 appearance
1 They
1 wore
1 coronets
1 on
1 their
1 heads
1 adorned
1 with
1 the
1 red
1 tail
1 feathers
1 of
1 the
1 common
1 gray
1 parrot
1 Most
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 had
1 beards
1 which
1 were
1 divided
1 in
1 the
1 middle
1 red
1 and
1 white
1 beads
1 being
1 strung
1 up
1 the
1 tips
1 Some
1 wore
1 only
1 a
1 strip
1 of
1 goatskin
1 hanging
1 from
1 the
1 waist
1 or
1 the
1 skin
1 of
1 a
1 tigercat
1 while
1 others
1 had
1 short
1 petticoats
1 made
1 of
1 cloth
1 woven
1 from
1 the
1 inner
1 bark
1 of
1 a
1 tree
1 The
1 travelers
1 were
1 led
1 to
1 the
1 hut
1 of
1 the
1 chief
1 where
1 they
1 were
1 surrounded
1 by
1 a
1 mob
1 of
1 the
1 cannibals
1 The
1 Houssas
1 had
1 been
1 strictly
1 enjoined
1 to
1 leave
1 their
1 guns
1 in
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 canoe
1 as
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 desired
1 to
1 avoid
1 all
1 appearance
1 of
1 armed
1 force
1 The
1 chief
1 demanded
1 of
1 Ostik
1 what
1 these
1 two
1 white
1 men
1 wanted
1 here
1 and
1 whether
1 they
1 had
1 come
1 to
1 trade
1 Ostik
1 replied
1 that
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 were
1 going
1 up
1 the
1 river
1 into
1 the
1 country
1 beyond
1 to
1 shoot
1 elephants
1 and
1 buy
1 ivory
1 that
1 they
1 did
1 not
1 want
1 to
1 trade
1 for
1 logwood
1 or
1 oil
1 but
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 give
1 presents
1 to
1 the
1 chiefs
1 of
1 the
1 Fan
1 villages
1 A
1 score
1 of
1 cheap
1 Birmingham
1 muskets
1 had
1 been
1 brought
1 from
1 England
1 by
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 for
1 this
1 purpose
1 One
1 of
1 these
1 was
1 now
1 bestowed
1 upon
1 the
1 chief
1 together
1 with
1 some
1 powder
1 and
1 ball
1 three
1 bright
1 cotton
1 handkerchiefs
1 some
1 gaudy
1 glass
1 beads
1 and
1 two
1 looking
1 glasses
1 for
1 his
1 wives
1 This
1 was
1 considered
1 perfectly
1 satisfactory
1 The
1 crowd
1 was
1 very
1 great
1 and
1 at
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 dictation
1 Ostik
1 informed
1 the
1 chief
1 that
1 if
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 were
1 left
1 quiet
1 until
1 the
1 evening
1 they
1 would
1 show
1 his
1 people
1 many
1 strange
1 things
1 On
1 the
1 receipt
1 of
1 this
1 information
1 the
1 crowd
1 dispersed
1 But
1 when
1 at
1 sunset
1 the
1 two
1 travelers
1 took
1 a
1 turn
1 through
1 the
1 village
1 the
1 excitement
1 was
1 again
1 very
1 great
1 The
1 men
1 stood
1 their
1 ground
1 and
1 stared
1 at
1 them
1 but
1 the
1 women
1 and
1 children
1 ran
1 screaming
1 away
1 to
1 hide
1 themselves
1 The
1 idea
1 of
1 the
1 people
1 of
1 Central
1 Africa
1 of
1 the
1 whites
1 is
1 that
1 they
1 are
1 few
1 in
1 number
1 that
1 they
1 live
1 at
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 and
1 are
1 possessed
1 of
1 great
1 wealth
1 but
1 that
1 they
1 have
1 no
1 palm
1 oil
1 or
1 logwood
1 and
1 are
1 therefore
1 compelled
1 to
1 come
1 to
1 land
1 to
1 trade
1 for
1 these
1 articles
1 They
1 believe
1 that
1 the
1 strange
1 clothes
1 they
1 wear
1 are
1 manufactured
1 from
1 the
1 skins
1 of
1 sea
1 beasts
1 hen
1 night
1 fell
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 fastened
1 a
1 sheet
1 against
1 the
1 outside
1 of
1 the
1 chief
1 s
1 hut
1 and
1 then
1 placed
1 a
1 magic
1 lantern
1 in
1 position
1 ten
1 paces
1 from
1 it
1 The
1 Fans
1 were
1 then
1 invited
1 to
1 gather
1 round
1 and
1 take
1 their
1 seats
1 upon
1 the
1 ground
1 A
1 cry
1 of
1 astonishment
1 greeted
1 the
1 appearance
1 of
1 the
1 bright
1 disk
1 This
1 was
1 followed
1 by
1 a
1 wilder
1 yell
1 when
1 this
1 was
1 darkened
1 and
1 an
1 elephant
1 bearing
1 some
1 men
1 sitting
1 on
1 his
1 back
1 was
1 seen
1 to
1 cross
1 the
1 house
1 The
1 men
1 leaped
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 and
1 seized
1 their
1 spears
1 The
1 women
1 screamed
1 and
1 Ostik
1 who
1 was
1 himself
1 somewhat
1 alarmed
1 had
1 great
1 difficulty
1 in
1 calming
1 their
1 fears
1 and
1 persuading
1 them
1 to
1 sit
1 down
1 again
1 assuring
1 them
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 see
1 many
1 wonderful
1 things
1 but
1 that
1 nothing
1 would
1 hurt
1 them
1 The
1 next
1 view
1 was
1 at
1 first
1 incomprehensible
1 to
1 many
1 of
1 them
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 ship
1 tossing
1 in
1 a
1 stormy
1 sea
1 but
1 some
1 of
1 those
1 present
1 had
1 been
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 and
1 these
1 explained
1 to
1 the
1 others
1 the
1 nature
1 of
1 the
1 phenomenon
1 In
1 all
1 there
1 were
1 twenty
1 slides
1 all
1 of
1 which
1 were
1 provided
1 with
1 movable
1 figures
1 the
1 last
1 two
1 being
1 chromatropes
1 whose
1 dancing
1 colors
1 elicited
1 screams
1 of
1 delight
1 from
1 the
1 astonished
1 natives
1 This
1 concluded
1 the
1 performance
1 but
1 for
1 hours
1 after
1 it
1 was
1 over
1 the
1 village
1 rang
1 with
1 a
1 perfect
1 Babel
1 of
1 shouts
1 screams
1 and
1 chatter
1 The
1 whole
1 thing
1 was
1 to
1 the
1 Fans
1 absolutely
1 incomprehensible
1 and
1 their
1 astonishment
1 was
1 equalled
1 by
1 their
1 awe
1 at
1 the
1 powers
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 The
1 next
1 two
1 days
1 they
1 remained
1 at
1 Olenga
1 as
1 word
1 was
1 sent
1 up
1 to
1 Itchongue
1 the
1 next
1 town
1 asking
1 the
1 chief
1 there
1 for
1 leave
1 to
1 come
1 forward
1 The
1 people
1 had
1 now
1 begun
1 to
1 get
1 over
1 their
1 first
1 timidity
1 and
1 when
1 Frank
1 went
1 out
1 for
1 a
1 walk
1 after
1 breakfast
1 he
1 was
1 somewhat
1 embarrassed
1 by
1 the
1 women
1 and
1 girls
1 crowding
1 round
1 him
1 feeling
1 his
1 clothes
1 and
1 touching
1 his
1 hands
1 and
1 face
1 to
1 assure
1 themselves
1 that
1 these
1 felt
1 like
1 those
1 of
1 human
1 beings
1 He
1 afforded
1 them
1 huge
1 delight
1 by
1 taking
1 off
1 his
1 Norfolk
1 jacket
1 and
1 pulling
1 up
1 the
1 sleeves
1 of
1 his
1 shirt
1 to
1 show
1 them
1 that
1 his
1 arms
1 were
1 the
1 same
1 color
1 as
1 his
1 hands
1 and
1 so
1 elated
1 were
1 they
1 with
1 this
1 exhibition
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 with
1 great
1 difficulty
1 that
1 he
1 withstood
1 their
1 entreaties
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 disrobe
1 entirely
1 Indeed
1 Ostik
1 had
1 at
1 last
1 to
1 come
1 to
1 his
1 rescue
1 and
1 carry
1 him
1 off
1 from
1 the
1 laughing
1 crowd
1 by
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 surrounded
1 After
1 dinner
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 invited
1 the
1 people
1 to
1 sit
1 down
1 in
1 a
1 vast
1 circle
1 holding
1 each
1 other
1 s
1 hands
1 He
1 then
1 told
1 them
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 at
1 a
1 word
1 make
1 them
1 all
1 jump
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 Then
1 taking
1 out
1 a
1 small
1 but
1 powerful
1 galvanic
1 battery
1 he
1 arranged
1 it
1 and
1 placed
1 wires
1 into
1 the
1 hands
1 of
1 the
1 two
1 men
1 nearest
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 the
1 great
1 circle
1 Now
1 he
1 said
1 when
1 I
1 clap
1 my
1 hands
1 you
1 will
1 find
1 that
1 you
1 are
1 all
1 obliged
1 to
1 jump
1 up
1 He
1 gave
1 the
1 signal
1 Frank
1 turned
1 on
1 the
1 battery
1 and
1 in
1 an
1 instant
1 the
1 two
1 hundred
1 men
1 and
1 women
1 with
1 a
1 wild
1 shriek
1 either
1 leapt
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 or
1 rolled
1 backward
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 In
1 another
1 minute
1 not
1 a
1 native
1 was
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 with
1 the
1 exception
1 of
1 the
1 chief
1 who
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 included
1 in
1 the
1 circle
1 The
1 latter
1 at
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 request
1 shouted
1 loudly
1 to
1 his
1 subjects
1 to
1 return
1 for
1 that
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 would
1 do
1 them
1 no
1 harm
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 before
1 slowly
1 and
1 cautiously
1 they
1 crept
1 back
1 again
1 hen
1 they
1 had
1 reassembled
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 showed
1 them
1 several
1 simple
1 but
1 astonishing
1 chemical
1 experiments
1 which
1 stupefied
1 them
1 with
1 wonder
1 and
1 concluded
1 with
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 conjuring
1 tricks
1 which
1 completed
1 their
1 amazement
1 A
1 long
1 day
1 s
1 paddling
1 took
1 them
1 to
1 Itchongue
1 where
1 they
1 were
1 as
1 well
1 received
1 as
1 at
1 Olenga
1 Here
1 they
1 stopped
1 for
1 two
1 days
1 and
1 the
1 magic
1 lantern
1 was
1 again
1 brought
1 out
1 and
1 the
1 other
1 tricks
1 repeated
1 with
1 a
1 success
1 equal
1 to
1 that
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 before
1 obtained
1 As
1 another
1 day
1 s
1 paddling
1 would
1 take
1 them
1 to
1 the
1 rapids
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 now
1 set
1 up
1 a
1 negotiation
1 for
1 obtaining
1 a
1 sufficient
1 number
1 of
1 carriers
1 After
1 great
1 palaver
1 and
1 the
1 presentation
1 of
1 three
1 guns
1 to
1 the
1 chief
1 to
1 obtain
1 his
1 assistance
1 thirty
1 men
1 were
1 engaged
1 These
1 were
1 each
1 to
1 receive
1 a
1 yard
1 of
1 calico
1 or
1 one
1 brass
1 stair
1 rod
1 a
1 day
1 and
1 were
1 to
1 proceed
1 with
1 the
1 party
1 until
1 such
1 time
1 as
1 they
1 could
1 procure
1 carriers
1 from
1 another
1 tribe
1 The
1 new
1 recruits
1 were
1 taken
1 up
1 in
1 another
1 canoe
1 Several
1 villages
1 were
1 passed
1 on
1 the
1 way
1 The
1 river
1 became
1 a
1 mere
1 rapid
1 against
1 which
1 the
1 canoes
1 with
1 difficulty
1 made
1 their
1 way
1 They
1 had
1 now
1 entered
1 the
1 mountains
1 which
1 rose
1 steeply
1 above
1 them
1 embowered
1 in
1 wood
1 Two
1 days
1 of
1 severe
1 work
1 took
1 them
1 to
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 falls
1 Here
1 the
1 canoes
1 were
1 unloaded
1 The
1 men
1 hired
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 received
1 their
1 pay
1 and
1 turned
1 the
1 boat
1 s
1 head
1 down
1 stream
1 The
1 other
1 canoe
1 accompanied
1 it
1 and
1 the
1 travelers
1 remained
1 with
1 their
1 bodyguard
1 of
1 Houssas
1 and
1 their
1 carriers
1 Now
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 we
1 are
1 fairly
1 embarked
1 on
1 our
1 journey
1 and
1 we
1 will
1 commence
1 operations
1 at
1 once
1 I
1 have
1 heard
1 the
1 cries
1 of
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 birds
1 which
1 are
1 strange
1 to
1 me
1 today
1 and
1 I
1 expect
1 that
1 we
1 shall
1 have
1 a
1 good
1 harvest
1 e
1 may
1 remain
1 here
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 The
1 first
1 thing
1 to
1 do
1 is
1 to
1 find
1 food
1 for
1 our
1 followers
1 e
1 have
1 got
1 six
1 sacks
1 of
1 rice
1 but
1 it
1 will
1 never
1 do
1 to
1 let
1 our
1 men
1 depend
1 solely
1 upon
1 these
1 They
1 would
1 soon
1 come
1 to
1 an
1 end
1 But
1 how
1 are
1 we
1 to
1 feed
1 forty
1 people
1 Frank
1 asked
1 in
1 astonishment
1 I
1 pointed
1 out
1 to
1 you
1 today
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 the
1 tracks
1 of
1 hippopotami
1 in
1 various
1 places
1 One
1 of
1 these
1 beasts
1 will
1 feed
1 the
1 men
1 for
1 nearly
1 a
1 week
1 There
1 were
1 too
1 numbers
1 of
1 alligators
1 eggs
1 on
1 the
1 banks
1 and
1 these
1 creatures
1 make
1 by
1 no
1 means
1 bad
1 eating
1 Your
1 rifle
1 will
1 be
1 of
1 no
1 use
1 against
1 such
1 animals
1 as
1 these
1 You
1 had
1 better
1 take
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Sniders
1 I
1 have
1 some
1 explosive
1 shells
1 which
1 will
1 fit
1 them
1 My
1 own
1 double
1 barrelled
1 rifle
1 is
1 of
1 the
1 same
1 bore
1 After
1 dinner
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 told
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 to
1 accompany
1 them
1 with
1 their
1 rifles
1 together
1 with
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 He
1 made
1 his
1 way
1 down
1 the
1 stream
1 to
1 a
1 point
1 where
1 the
1 hills
1 receded
1 and
1 where
1 he
1 had
1 observed
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 marks
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 horses
1 As
1 they
1 approached
1 the
1 spot
1 they
1 heard
1 several
1 loud
1 snorts
1 and
1 making
1 their
1 way
1 along
1 as
1 quietly
1 as
1 possible
1 they
1 saw
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 great
1 beasts
1 standing
1 in
1 the

1 it
1 widened
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 and
1 was
1 shallow
1 and
1 quite
1 near
1 the
1 bank
1 The
1 Fans
1 had
1 been
1 told
1 to
1 stay
1 behind
1 directly
1 the
1 snorting
1 was
1 heard
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 rifle
1 in
1 hand
1 crept
1 forward

1 CHAPTER
1 X
1 LOST
1 IN
1 THE
1 FOREST
1 The
1 hippopotami
1 were
1 playing
1 together
1 floundering
1 in
1 the
1 shallow
1 water
1 and
1 the
1 noise
1 they
1 made
1 prevented
1 their
1 hearing
1 the
1 stealthy
1 approach
1 of
1 their
1 enemies
1 You
1 take
1 the
1 one
1 nearest
1 shore
1 Frank
1 I
1 will
1 take
1 the
1 other
1 Aim
1 at
1 the
1 forehead
1 between
1 the
1 eyes
1 I
1 will
1 make
1 a
1 slight
1 sound
1 to
1 attract
1 their
1 attention
1 Frank
1 knelt
1 on
1 one
1 knee
1 and
1 took
1 steady
1 aim
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 then
1 gave
1 a
1 shout
1 and
1 the
1 two
1 animals
1 turning
1 their
1 heads
1 stood
1 staring
1 at
1 the
1 foliage
1 scarce
1 a
1 dozen
1 yards
1 away
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 travelers
1 were
1 concealed
1 The
1 guns
1 flashed
1 at
1 the
1 same
1 moment
1 and
1 as
1 if
1 struck
1 by
1 lightning
1 the
1 hippopotami
1 fell
1 in
1 the
1 stream
1 The
1 explosive
1 balls
1 had
1 both
1 flown
1 true
1 to
1 the
1 mark
1 invariably
1 a
1 fatal
1 one
1 in
1 the
1 case
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 horse
1 Frank
1 as
1 he
1 fired
1 had
1 taken
1 another
1 rifle
1 which
1 the
1 Houssas
1 held
1 in
1 readiness
1 for
1 him
1 but
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 occasion
1 for
1 its
1 use
1 The
1 Fans
1 came
1 running
1 up
1 and
1 on
1 seeing
1 the
1 great
1 beasts
1 lying
1 in
1 the
1 stream
1 gave
1 a
1 shout
1 of
1 joy
1 That
1 will
1 do
1 for
1 this
1 evening
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 They
1 are
1 large
1 beasts
1 and
1 will
1 give
1 food
1 enough
1 for
1 a
1 week
1 or
1 ten
1 days
1 They
1 then
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 which
1 at
1 the
1 news
1 brought
1 by
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 had
1 already
1 been
1 deserted
1 Before
1 the
1 natives
1 retired
1 to
1 sleep
1 the
1 hippopotami
1 had
1 been
1 cut
1 up
1 and
1 carried
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 Portions
1 were
1 already
1 frizzling
1 over
1 the
1 fires
1 other
1 parts
1 set
1 aside
1 for
1 the
1 consumption
1 of
1 the
1 next
1 two
1 days
1 and
1 the
1 rest
1 cut
1 up
1 in
1 strips
1 to
1 be
1 dried
1 in
1 the
1 sun
1 The
1 tongue
1 of
1 one
1 was
1 cut
1 up
1 and
1 fried
1 as
1 a
1 great
1 luxury
1 for
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 s
1 supper
1 by
1 Ostik
1 It
1 is
1 not
1 often
1 that
1 the
1 natives
1 of
1 equatorial
1 Africa
1 are
1 able
1 to
1 indulge
1 in
1 meat
1 and
1 the
1 joy
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 at
1 this
1 abundant
1 supply
1 and
1 the
1 prospect
1 afforded
1 them
1 of
1 further
1 good
1 eating
1 raised
1 their
1 spirits
1 to
1 the
1 highest
1 extent
1 Next
1 morning
1 at
1 daybreak
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 set
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 camp
1 Each
1 carried
1 a
1 double
1 barreled
1 gun
1 and
1 was
1 accompanied
1 by
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 carrying
1 his
1 rifle
1 and
1 a
1 butterfly
1 net
1 and
1 when
1 three
1 hours
1 later
1 they
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 for
1 breakfast
1 and
1 compared
1 their
1 spoils
1 they
1 found
1 that
1 an
1 excellent
1 beginning
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 Nearly
1 a
1 score
1 of
1 birds
1 of
1 which
1 several
1 were
1 very
1 rare
1 and
1 five
1 were
1 pronounced
1 by
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 to
1 be
1 entirely
1 new
1 had
1 been
1 shot
1 and
1 many
1 butterflies
1 captured
1 Frank
1 had
1 been
1 most
1 successful
1 in
1 this
1 respect
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 come
1 across
1 a
1 small
1 clearing
1 in
1 which
1 were
1 several
1 deserted
1 huts
1 This
1 was
1 just
1 the
1 place
1 in
1 which
1 butterflies
1 delight
1 for
1 although
1 many
1 kinds
1 prefer
1 the
1 deep
1 shades
1 of
1 the
1 forest
1 by
1 far
1 the
1 greater
1 portion
1 love
1 the
1 bright
1 sunlight
1 After
1 breakfast
1 they
1 again
1 set
1 out
1 Frank
1 this
1 time
1 keeping
1 along
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 stream
1 where
1 he
1 had
1 observed
1 many
1 butterflies
1 as
1 he
1 came
1 up
1 and
1 where
1 many
1 birds
1 of
1 the
1 kingfisher
1 family
1 had
1 also
1 been
1 seen
1 He
1 had
1 been
1 very
1 successful
1 and
1 was
1 walking
1 along
1 by
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 water
1 with
1 his
1 eyes
1 fixed
1 upon
1 the
1 trees
1 above
1 where
1 he
1 had
1 a
1 minute
1 before
1 heard
1 the
1 call
1 of
1 a
1 bird
1 when
1 he
1 was
1 startled
1 by
1 a
1 shout
1 from
1 the
1 Houssa
1 behind
1 him
1 He
1 involuntarily
1 sprang
1 back
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 well
1 he
1 did
1 so
1 for
1 on
1 the
1 instant
1 something
1 swept
1 by
1 within
1 an
1 inch
1 or
1 two
1 of
1 his
1 head
1 Looking
1 round
1 he
1 saw
1 at
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 stream
1 below
1 him
1 a
1 huge
1 alligator
1 This
1 had
1 struck
1 at
1 him
1 with
1 its
1 tail
1 -
1 -the
1 usual
1 manner
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 alligator
1 supplies
1 itself
1 with
1 food
1 -
1 -and
1 had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 for
1 the
1 warning
1 cry
1 of
1 the
1 Houssa
1 would
1 have
1 knocked
1 him
1 into
1 the
1 stream
1 Its
1 mouth
1 was
1 open
1 and
1 Frank
1 as
1 if
1 by
1 instinct
1 fired
1 the
1 contents
1 of
1 both
1 barrels
1 into
1 its
1 throat
1 The
1 animal
1 rolled
1 over
1 on
1 to
1 its
1 back
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 and
1 then
1 turned
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 struggle
1 to
1 regain
1 the
1 bank
1 The
1 Houssa
1 however
1 had
1 run
1 up
1 and
1 placing
1 the
1 muzzle
1 of
1 his
1 gun
1 within
1 a
1 foot
1 of
1 its
1 eye
1 fired
1 and
1 the
1 creature
1 rolled
1 over
1 dead
1 and
1 was
1 swept
1 away
1 by
1 the
1 stream
1 The
1 Houssa
1 gave
1 a
1 loud
1 shout
1 which
1 was
1 answered
1 in
1 the
1 distance
1 He
1 then
1 shouted
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 words
1 and
1 turning
1 to
1 Frank
1 said
1 Men
1 get
1 alligator
1 and
1 proceeded
1 on
1 his
1 way
1 without
1 concerning
1 himself
1 further
1 in
1 the
1 matter
1 On
1 his
1 return
1 to
1 camp
1 in
1 the
1 evening
1 Frank
1 found
1 that
1 the
1 alligator
1 had
1 been
1 discovered
1 and
1 fished
1 out
1 and
1 that
1 its
1 steaks
1 were
1 by
1 no
1 means
1 bad
1 eating
1 Frank
1 told
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 of
1 the
1 narrow
1 escape
1 he
1 had
1 had
1 and
1 the
1 latter
1 pointed
1 out
1 to
1 him
1 the
1 necessity
1 of
1 always
1 keeping
1 his
1 eyes
1 on
1 the
1 watch
1 Alligators
1 frequently
1 carry
1 off
1 the
1 native
1 women
1 when
1 engaged
1 in
1 washing
1 he
1 said
1 and
1 almost
1 invariably
1 strike
1 them
1 in
1 the
1 first
1 place
1 into
1 the
1 river
1 with
1 a
1 blow
1 of
1 their
1 tails
1 Once
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 they
1 are
1 carried
1 off
1 drowned
1 and
1 eaten
1 at
1 leisure
1 Sometimes
1 indeed
1 a
1 woman
1 may
1 escape
1 with
1 the
1 loss
1 of
1 a
1 foot
1 or
1 arm
1 but
1 this
1 is
1 the
1 exception
1 hat
1 is
1 the
1 best
1 thing
1 to
1 do
1 when
1 so
1 attacked
1 Frank
1 asked
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 mean
1 to
1 be
1 caught
1 napping
1 again
1 still
1 it
1 is
1 as
1 well
1 to
1 know
1 what
1 to
1 do
1 if
1 I
1 am
1 Men
1 when
1 so
1 attacked
1 have
1 been
1 known
1 frequently
1 to
1 escape
1 by
1 thrusting
1 their
1 thumbs
1 or
1 fingers
1 into
1 the
1 creature
1 s
1 eyes
1 If
1 it
1 can
1 be
1 done
1 the
1 alligator
1 is
1 sure
1 to
1 lose
1 his
1 hold
1 but
1 it
1 demands
1 quickness
1 and
1 great
1 presence
1 of
1 mind
1 hen
1 a
1 reptile
1 is
1 tearing
1 at
1 one
1 s
1 leg
1 and
1 hurrying
1 one
1 along
1 under
1 water
1 you
1 can
1 see
1 that
1 the
1 nerve
1 required
1 to
1 keep
1 perfectly
1 cool
1 to
1 feel
1 for
1 the
1 creature
1 s
1 eyes
1 and
1 to
1 thrust
1 your
1 finger
1 into
1 them
1 is
1 very
1 great
1 The
1 best
1 plan
1 Frank
1 distinctly
1 is
1 to
1 keep
1 out
1 of
1 their
1 reach
1 altogether
1 After
1 remaining
1 for
1 a
1 fortnight
1 at
1 their
1 camp
1 they
1 prepared
1 for
1 a
1 move
1 Another
1 hippopotamus
1 was
1 killed
1 cut
1 up
1 and
1 dried
1 and
1 the
1 flesh
1 added
1 to
1 the
1 burdens
1 Then
1 the
1 tent
1 was
1 struck
1 and
1 they
1 proceeded
1 farther
1 into
1 the
1 mountains
1 Two
1 days
1 later
1 they
1 halted
1 again
1 the
1 site
1 being
1 chosen
1 beside
1 a
1 little
1 mountain
1 rivulet
1 They
1 were
1 now
1 very
1 high
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 hills
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 expecting
1 to
1 meet
1 with
1 new
1 varieties
1 of
1 butterflies
1 and
1 insects
1 at
1 this
1 elevation
1 They
1 had
1 scarcely
1 pitched
1 their
1 camp
1 when
1 Frank
1 exclaimed
1 Surely
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 I
1 can
1 hear
1 some
1 dogs
1 barking
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 know
1 that
1 the
1 native
1 dogs
1 barked
1 Nor
1 do
1 they
1 They
1 may
1 yelp
1 and
1 howl
1 but
1 they
1 never
1 bark
1 like
1 European
1 dogs
1 hat
1 you
1 hear
1 is
1 the
1 bark
1 of
1 some
1 sort
1 of
1 monkey
1 or
1 baboon
1 This
1 opinion
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 confirmed
1 by
1 the
1 Fans
1 e
1 will
1 sally
1 out
1 with
1 our
1 guns
1 at
1 once
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 like
1 the
1 thought
1 of
1 shooting
1 monkeys
1 Frank
1 muttered
1 as
1 he
1 took
1 up
1 his
1 inchester
1 carbine
1 They
1 are
1 very
1 excellent
1 eating
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 continued
1 superior
1 in
1 my
1 opinion
1 and
1 indeed
1 in
1 that
1 of
1 most
1 travelers
1 to
1 any
1 other
1 meat
1 e
1 shall
1 meet
1 with
1 no
1 other
1 kind
1 of
1 creature
1 fit
1 for
1 food
1 up
1 here
1 The
1 birds
1 indeed
1 supply
1 us
1 amply
1 but
1 for
1 the
1 men
1 it
1 is
1 desirable
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 obtain
1 fresh
1 meat
1 when
1 we
1 have
1 the
1 chance
1 These
1 baboons
1 are
1 very
1 mischievous
1 creatures
1 and
1 are
1 not
1 to
1 be
1 attacked
1 with
1 impunity
1 Let
1 four
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 with
1 their
1 guns
1 come
1 with
1 us
1 Following
1 the
1 direction
1 of
1 the
1 sounds
1 they
1 had
1 heard
1 the
1 travelers
1 came
1 upon
1 a
1 troupe
1 of
1 great
1 baboons
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 curious
1 sight
1 The
1 males
1 were
1 as
1 big
1 as
1 large
1 dogs
1 some
1 were
1 sitting
1 sunning
1 themselves
1 on
1 rocks
1 others
1 were
1 being
1 scratched
1 by
1 the
1 females
1 Many
1 of
1 these
1 had
1 a
1 baby
1 monkey
1 clinging
1 on
1 their
1 necks
1 while
1 others
1 were
1 playing
1 about
1 in
1 all
1 directions
1 I
1 d
1 rather
1 not
1 shoot
1 at
1 them
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Frank
1 said
1 You
1 will
1 be
1 glad
1 enough
1 to
1 eat
1 them
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 and
1 selecting
1 a
1 big
1 male
1 he
1 fired
1 The
1 creature
1 fell
1 dead
1 The
1 others
1 all
1 sprang
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 The
1 females
1 and
1 little
1 ones
1 scampered
1 off
1 The
1 males
1 with
1 angry
1 gestures
1 rushed
1 upon
1 their
1 assailants
1 barking
1 showing
1 their
1 teeth
1 and
1 making
1 menacing
1 gestures
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 fired
1 again
1 and
1 Frank
1 now
1 seeing
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 likely
1 to
1 be
1 attacked
1 also
1 opened
1 fire
1 Six
1 of
1 the
1 baboons
1 were
1 killed
1 before
1 the
1 others
1 abstained
1 from
1 the
1 attack
1 and
1 went
1 screaming
1 after
1 the
1 females
1 The
1 dead
1 baboons
1 were
1 brought
1 down
1 skinned
1 and
1 two
1 were
1 at
1 once
1 roasted
1 the
1 others
1 hung
1 up
1 to
1 trees
1 It
1 required
1 a
1 great
1 effort
1 on
1 Frank
1 s
1 part
1 to
1 overcome
1 his
1 repugnance
1 to
1 tasting
1 these
1 creatures
1 but
1 when
1 he
1 did
1 so
1 he
1 admitted
1 that
1 the
1 meat
1 was
1 excellent
1 That
1 night
1 they
1 were
1 disturbed
1 by
1 a
1 cry
1 of
1 terror
1 from
1 the
1 men
1 Seizing
1 their
1 rifles
1 they
1 ran
1 out
1 There
1 are
1 two
1 leopards
1 sar
1 Ostik
1 said
1 they
1 have
1 smelt
1 the
1 monkeys
1 The
1 shouts
1 scared
1 the
1 creatures
1 away
1 and
1 the
1 natives
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 great
1 fire
1 till
1 morning
1 e
1 must
1 get
1 the
1 skins
1 if
1 we
1 can
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 The
1 skins
1 of
1 the
1 equatorial
1 leopard
1 are
1 rare
1 If
1 we
1 can
1 get
1 them
1 both
1 they
1 will
1 make
1 a
1 fine
1 group
1 for
1 you
1 to
1 stuff
1 when
1 you
1 get
1 back
1 Frank
1 Are
1 you
1 thinking
1 of
1 following
1 their
1 trail
1 Frank
1 asked
1 That
1 would
1 be
1 useless
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 In
1 soft
1 swampy
1 ground
1 we
1 might
1 do
1 so
1 but
1 up
1 here
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 question
1 e
1 must
1 set
1 a
1 bait
1 for
1 them
1 tonight
1 but
1 be
1 careful
1 while
1 you
1 are
1 out
1 today
1 They
1 have
1 probably
1 not
1 gone
1 far
1 from
1 the
1 camp
1 and
1 they
1 are
1 very
1 formidable
1 beasts
1 They
1 not
1 unfrequently
1 attack
1 and
1 kill
1 the
1 natives
1 The
1 Fans
1 were
1 much
1 alarmed
1 at
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 of
1 the
1 leopards
1 and
1 none
1 would
1 leave
1 the
1 camp
1 during
1 the
1 day
1 Two
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 were
1 left
1 on
1 guard
1 although
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 felt
1 sure
1 that
1 the
1 animals
1 would
1 not
1 attempt
1 to
1 carry
1 off
1 any
1 meat
1 in
1 the
1 daylight
1 and
1 two
1 Houssas
1 accompanied
1 each
1 of
1 the
1 travelers
1 while
1 out
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 butterflies
1 Nothing
1 was
1 heard
1 of
1 the
1 leopards
1 during
1 the
1 day
1 At
1 nightfall
1 a
1 portion
1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 monkeys
1 was
1 roasted
1 and
1 hung
1 up
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 swing
1 within
1 four
1 feet
1 of
1 the
1 ground
1 from
1 the
1 arm
1 of
1 a
1 tree
1 a
1 hundred
1 yards
1 from
1 the
1 camp
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 took
1 their
1 seats
1 in
1 another
1 tree
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 off
1 The
1 night
1 was
1 fine
1 and
1 the
1 stars
1 clear
1 and
1 bright
1 The
1 tree
1 on
1 which
1 the
1 meat
1 hung
1 stood
1 somewhat
1 alone
1 so
1 that
1 sufficient
1 light
1 penetrated
1 from
1 above
1 to
1 enable
1 any
1 creatures
1 approaching
1 the
1 bait
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 Instead
1 of
1 his
1 little
1 inchester
1 Frank
1 had
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Sniders
1 with
1 explosive
1 bullets
1 The
1 Houssas
1 were
1 told
1 to
1 keep
1 a
1 sharp
1 watch
1 in
1 camp
1 in
1 case
1 the
1 leopards
1 approaching
1 from
1 the
1 other
1 side
1 might
1 be
1 attracted
1 by
1 the
1 smell
1 of
1 meat
1 there
1 rather
1 than
1 by
1 the
1 bait
1 The
1 Fans
1 needed
1 no
1 telling
1 to
1 induce
1 them
1 to
1 keep
1 up
1 great
1 fires
1 all
1 night
1 Soon
1 after
1 dark
1 the
1 watchers
1 heard
1 a
1 roaring
1 in
1 the
1 forest
1 It
1 came
1 from
1 the
1 other
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 camp
1 That
1 is
1 unlucky
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 e
1 have
1 pitched
1 on
1 the
1 wrong
1 side
1 However
1 they
1 will
1 probably
1 be
1 deterred
1 by
1 the
1 fire
1 from
1 approaching
1 the
1 camp
1 and
1 will
1 wander
1 round
1 and
1 round
1 so
1 we
1 may
1 hope
1 to
1 hear
1 of
1 them
1 before
1 long
1 In
1 answer
1 to
1 the
1 roar
1 of
1 the
1 leopards
1 the
1 natives
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 continued
1 shouting
1 For
1 some
1 hours
1 the
1 roaring
1 continued
1 at
1 intervals
1 sometimes
1 close
1 at
1 hand
1 sometimes
1 at
1 a
1 considerable
1 distance
1 Frank
1 had
1 some
1 difficulty
1 in
1 keeping
1 awake
1 and
1 was
1 beginning
1 to
1 wish
1 that
1 the
1 leopards
1 would
1 move
1 off
1 altogether
1 Two
1 or
1 three
1 times
1 he
1 had
1 nearly
1 dozed
1 off
1 and
1 his
1 rifle
1 had
1 almost
1 slipped
1 from
1 his
1 hold
1 All
1 at
1 once
1 he
1 was
1 aroused
1 by
1 a
1 sharp
1 nudge
1 from
1 his
1 companion
1 Fixing
1 his
1 eyes
1 on
1 the
1 bait
1 he
1 made
1 out
1 something
1 immediately
1 below
1 it
1 Directly
1 afterwards
1 another
1 creature
1 stole
1 forward
1 They
1 were
1 far
1 less
1 distinct
1 than
1 he
1 had
1 expected
1 You
1 take
1 the
1 one
1 to
1 the
1 left
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 whispered
1 Now
1 They
1 fired
1 together
1 Two
1 tremendous
1 roars
1 were
1 heard
1 One
1 of
1 the
1 leopards
1 immediately
1 bounded
1 away
1 The
1 other
1 rolled
1 over
1 and
1 over
1 and
1 then
1 recovering
1 its
1 feet
1 followed
1 its
1 companion
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 firing
1 his
1 second
1 barrel
1 after
1 him
1 I
1 m
1 afraid
1 you
1 missed
1 altogether
1 Frank
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 so
1 sir
1 I
1 fancied
1 I
1 saw
1 the
1 flash
1 of
1 the
1 shell
1 as
1 it
1 struck
1 him
1 but
1 where
1 I
1 have
1 not
1 the
1 remotest
1 idea
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 make
1 him
1 out
1 clear
1 enough
1 It
1 was
1 merely
1 a
1 dim
1 shape
1 and
1 I
1 fired
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 I
1 could
1 at
1 the
1 middle
1 of
1 it
1 Shall
1 we
1 go
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 now
1 Frank
1 asked
1 Yes
1 we
1 can
1 safely
1 do
1 so
1 You
1 can
1 tell
1 by
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 the
1 roars
1 that
1 they
1 are
1 already
1 some
1 distance
1 away
1 There
1 is
1 little
1 chance
1 of
1 their
1 returning
1 tonight
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 we
1 will
1 follow
1 them
1 There
1 is
1 sure
1 to
1 be
1 blood
1 and
1 the
1 natives
1 will
1 have
1 no
1 difficulty
1 in
1 tracking
1 them
1 The
1 rest
1 of
1 the
1 night
1 passed
1 quietly
1 although
1 roars
1 and
1 howling
1 could
1 be
1 heard
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 in
1 the
1 distance
1 Early
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 they
1 started
1 with
1 the
1 Houssas
1 e
1 must
1 be
1 careful
1 today
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 for
1 a
1 wounded
1 leopard
1 is
1 a
1 really
1 formidable
1 beast
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 difficulty
1 in
1 taking
1 up
1 the
1 traces
1 One
1 of
1 them
1 at
1 least
1 must
1 be
1 hard
1 hit
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 remarked
1 there
1 are
1 traces
1 of
1 blood
1 every
1 yard
1 They
1 had
1 gone
1 but
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 when
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 gave
1 a
1 sudden
1 exclamation
1 and
1 pointed
1 to
1 something
1 lying
1 at
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 a
1 clump
1 of
1 bushes
1 Leopard
1 he
1 said
1 Yes
1 there
1 is
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 sure
1 enough
1 I
1 think
1 it
1 s
1 dead
1 but
1 we
1 cannot
1 be
1 too
1 cautious
1 Advance
1 very
1 carefully
1 Frank
1 keeping
1 ready
1 to
1 fire
1 instantly
1 They
1 moved
1 forward
1 slowly
1 in
1 a
1 body
1 but
1 their
1 precaution
1 was
1 unnecessary
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 movement
1 in
1 the
1 spotted
1 tawny
1 skin
1 as
1 they
1 advanced
1 and
1 when
1 they
1 came
1 close
1 they
1 could
1 see
1 that
1 the
1 leopard
1 was
1 really
1 dead
1 He
1 had
1 been
1 hit
1 by
1 two
1 bullets
1 The
1 first
1 had
1 struck
1 his
1 shoulder
1 and
1 exploded
1 there
1 inflicting
1 so
1 terrible
1 a
1 wound
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 wonderful
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 able
1 to
1 move
1 afterwards
1 The
1 other
1 had
1 struck
1 him
1 on
1 the
1 back
1 near
1 the
1 tail
1 and
1 had
1 burst
1 inside
1 him
1 Frank
1 on
1 seeing
1 the
1 nature
1 of
1 the
1 wounds
1 was
1 astonished
1 at
1 the
1 tenacity
1 of
1 life
1 shown
1 by
1 the
1 animal
1 I
1 wonder
1 whether
1 I
1 hit
1 the
1 other
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 doubt
1 at
1 all
1 about
1 it
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 although
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 think
1 so
1 before
1 It
1 seemed
1 to
1 me
1 that
1 I
1 only
1 heard
1 the
1 howls
1 of
1 one
1 animal
1 in
1 the
1 night
1 and
1 thought
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 one
1 I
1 had
1 hit
1 But
1 as
1 this
1 fellow
1 must
1 have
1 died
1 at
1 once
1 it
1 is
1 clear
1 that
1 the
1 cries
1 were
1 made
1 by
1 the
1 other
1 A
1 sharp
1 search
1 was
1 now
1 set
1 up
1 for
1 the
1 tracks
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 leopard
1 the
1 Houssas
1 going
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 tree
1 and
1 taking
1 it
1 up
1 anew
1 They
1 soon
1 found
1 traces
1 of
1 blood
1 in
1 a
1 line
1 diverging
1 from
1 that
1 followed
1 by
1 the
1 other
1 animal
1 For
1 an
1 hour
1 they
1 followed
1 this
1 great
1 care
1 being
1 required
1 as
1 at
1 times
1 no
1 spots
1 of
1 blood
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 for
1 a
1 considerable
1 distance
1 At
1 last
1 they
1 seemed
1 to
1 lose
1 it
1 altogether
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 stood
1 together
1 while
1 the
1 Houssas
1 scattered
1 round
1 were
1 hunting
1 like
1 well
1 trained
1 dogs
1 for
1 a
1 sign
1 Suddenly
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 sharp
1 roar
1 and
1 from
1 the
1 bough
1 of
1 a
1 tree
1 close
1 by
1 a
1 great
1 body
1 sprang
1 through
1 the
1 air
1 and
1 alighted
1 within
1 a
1 yard
1 of
1 Frank
1 The
1 latter
1 in
1 his
1 surprise
1 sprang
1 back
1 stumbled
1 and
1 fell
1 but
1 in
1 an
1 instant
1 the
1 report
1 of
1 the
1 two
1 barrels
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 rifle
1 rang
1 out
1 In
1 a
1 moment
1 Frank
1 was
1 on
1 his
1 feet
1 again
1 ready
1 to
1 fire
1 The
1 leopard
1 however
1 lay
1 dead
1 its
1 skull
1 almost
1 blown
1 off
1 You
1 have
1 had
1 another
1 narrow
1 escape
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 I
1 see
1 that
1 your
1 ball
1 last
1 night
1 broke
1 one
1 of
1 his
1 hind
1 legs
1 That
1 spoilt
1 his
1 spring
1 Had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 for
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 undoubtedly
1 have
1 reached
1 you
1 and
1 a
1 blow
1 with
1 his
1 paw
1 given
1 with
1 all
1 his
1 weight
1 and
1 impetus
1 would
1 probably
1 have
1 killed
1 you
1 on
1 the
1 spot
1 e
1 ought
1 not
1 to
1 have
1 stood
1 near
1 a
1 tree
1 strong
1 enough
1 to
1 bear
1 him
1 when
1 in
1 pursuit
1 of
1 a
1 wounded
1 leopard
1 They
1 will
1 always
1 take
1 to
1 trees
1 if
1 they
1 can
1 and
1 you
1 see
1 this
1 was
1 a
1 very
1 suitable
1 one
1 for
1 him
1 This
1 bough
1 on
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 lying
1 starts
1 from
1 the
1 trunk
1 only
1 about
1 four
1 feet
1 from
1 the
1 ground
1 so
1 that
1 even
1 with
1 his
1 broken
1 leg
1 he
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 get
1 upon
1 it
1 without
1 difficulty
1 ell
1 thank
1 God
1 you
1 ve
1 not
1 been
1 hurt
1 my
1 boy
1 It
1 will
1 teach
1 us
1 both
1 to
1 be
1 more
1 careful
1 in
1 future
1 That
1 afternoon
1 Frank
1 was
1 down
1 with
1 his
1 second
1 attack
1 of
1 fever
1 a
1 much
1 more
1 severe
1 one
1 than
1 the
1 first
1 had
1 been
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 favorite
1 remedy
1 had
1 its
1 effect
1 of
1 producing
1 profuse
1 perspiration
1 but
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 hours
1 afterwards
1 the
1 hot
1 fit
1 again
1 came
1 on
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 four
1 days
1 Frank
1 lay
1 half
1 delirious
1 at
1 one
1 time
1 consumed
1 with
1 heat
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 shivering
1 as
1 if
1 plunged
1 into
1 ice
1 water
1 Copious
1 doses
1 of
1 quinine
1 however
1 gradually
1 overcame
1 the
1 fever
1 and
1 on
1 the
1 fifth
1 day
1 he
1 was
1 convalescent
1 It
1 was
1 nevertheless
1 another
1 week
1 before
1 he
1 was
1 sufficiently
1 recovered
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 resume
1 his
1 hunting
1 expeditions
1 They
1 again
1 shifted
1 their
1 camp
1 and
1 this
1 time
1 traveled
1 for
1 three
1 weeks
1 making
1 short
1 journeys
1 and
1 halting
1 early
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 give
1 half
1 a
1 day
1 from
1 each
1 camping
1 place
1 for
1 their
1 work
1 Frank
1 was
1 one
1 day
1 out
1 as
1 usual
1 with
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 He
1 had
1 killed
1 several
1 birds
1 when
1 he
1 saw
1 a
1 butterfly
1 of
1 a
1 species
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 not
1 before
1 met
1 with
1 flitting
1 across
1 a
1 gleam
1 of
1 sunshine
1 which
1 streamed
1 in
1 through
1 a
1 rift
1 in
1 the
1 trees
1 He
1 told
1 his
1 Houssa
1 to
1 wait
1 where
1 he
1 was
1 in
1 charge
1 of
1 the
1 two
1 guns
1 and
1 birds
1 and
1 started
1 off
1 with
1 his
1 net
1 in
1 pursuit
1 of
1 the
1 butterfly
1 The
1 creature
1 fluttered
1 away
1 with
1 Frank
1 in
1 full
1 pursuit
1 Hither
1 and
1 thither
1 it
1 flitted
1 seemingly
1 taking
1 an
1 impish
1 delight
1 in
1 tantalizing
1 Frank
1 settling
1 on
1 a
1 spot
1 where
1 a
1 gleam
1 of
1 sunlight
1 streamed
1 upon
1 the
1 bark
1 of
1 a
1 tree
1 till
1 Frank
1 had
1 stolen
1 up
1 within
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 paces
1 of
1 it
1 and
1 then
1 darting
1 away
1 again
1 at
1 a
1 pace
1 which
1 defied
1 Frank
1 s
1 best
1 attempts
1 to
1 keep
1 up
1 with
1 it
1 until
1 it
1 chose
1 to
1 play
1 with
1 him
1 again
1 Intent
1 only
1 upon
1 his
1 chase
1 Frank
1 thought
1 of
1 nothing
1 else
1 At
1 last
1 with
1 a
1 shout
1 of
1 triumph
1 he
1 inclosed
1 the
1 creature
1 in
1 his
1 net
1 shook
1 it
1 into
1 the
1 wide
1 pickle
1 bottle
1 containing
1 a
1 sponge
1 soaked
1 with
1 chloroform
1 and
1 then
1 after
1 tightly
1 fitting
1 in
1 the
1 stopper
1 he
1 looked
1 around
1 He
1 uttered
1 an
1 exclamation
1 of
1 dismay
1 as
1 he
1 did
1 so
1 He
1 saw
1 by
1 the
1 bands
1 of
1 light
1 the
1 sun
1 was
1 already
1 setting
1 and
1 knew
1 that
1 he
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 for
1 upwards
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 in
1 chase
1 of
1 the
1 butterfly
1 He
1 had
1 not
1 the
1 slightest
1 idea
1 of
1 the
1 direction
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 come
1 He
1 had
1 he
1 knew
1 run
1 up
1 hill
1 and
1 down
1 but
1 whether
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 traveling
1 in
1 a
1 circle
1 or
1 going
1 straight
1 in
1 one
1 direction
1 he
1 had
1 not
1 the
1 least
1 idea
1 He
1 might
1 be
1 within
1 a
1 hundred
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 he
1 had
1 left
1 the
1 Houssa
1 He
1 might
1 be
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 miles
1 away
1 He
1 at
1 once
1 drew
1 out
1 his
1 revolver
1 which
1 he
1 always
1 carried
1 strapped
1 to
1 his
1 belt
1 and
1 discharged
1 the
1 six
1 chambers
1 waiting
1 for
1 half
1 a
1 minute
1 between
1 each
1 shot
1 and
1 listening
1 intently
1 for
1 an
1 answer
1 to
1 his
1 signal
1 None
1 came
1 The
1 stillness
1 of
1 the
1 wood
1 was
1 unbroken
1 and
1 Frank
1 felt
1 that
1 he
1 must
1 have
1 wandered
1 far
1 indeed
1 from
1 his
1 starting
1 place
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 completely
1 lost
1 His
1 first
1 impulse
1 was
1 to
1 start
1 off
1 instantly
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 his
1 speed
1 but
1 a
1 moment
1 s
1 thought
1 convinced
1 him
1 that
1 this
1 would
1 be
1 useless
1 He
1 had
1 not
1 an
1 idea
1 of
1 the
1 direction
1 which
1 he
1 should
1 pursue
1 Besides
1 the
1 sun
1 was
1 sinking
1 twilight
1 is
1 short
1 in
1 the
1 tropics
1 and
1 in
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 as
1 dark
1 as
1 midnight
1 in
1 the
1 forest
1 Remembering
1 his
1 adventure
1 with
1 the
1 leopard
1 he
1 determined
1 to
1 climb
1 into
1 a
1 tree
1 and
1 pass
1 the
1 night
1 there
1 He
1 knew
1 that
1 an
1 active
1 search
1 would
1 be
1 set
1 on
1 foot
1 by
1 his
1 friends
1 next
1 morning
1 and
1 that
1 as
1 every
1 step
1 he
1 took
1 was
1 as
1 likely
1 to
1 lead
1 him
1 from
1 as
1 towards
1 the
1 camp
1 it
1 was
1 better
1 to
1 stay
1 where
1 he
1 was
1 He
1 soon
1 found
1 a
1 tree
1 with
1 a
1 branch
1 which
1 would
1 suit
1 his
1 purpose
1 and
1 climbing
1 up
1 into
1 it
1 lit
1 his
1 pipe
1 and
1 prepared
1 for
1 an
1 uncomfortable
1 night
1 Frank
1 had
1 never
1 smoked
1 until
1 he
1 reached
1 Africa
1 but
1 he
1 had
1 then
1 taken
1 to
1 it
1 on
1 the
1 advice
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 who
1 told
1 him
1 that
1 smoking
1 was
1 certainly
1 a
1 preventive
1 to
1 some
1 extent
1 of
1 fever
1 in
1 malarious
1 countries
1 and
1 although
1 he
1 had
1 not
1 liked
1 it
1 at
1 first
1 he
1 had
1 now
1 taken
1 kindly
1 to
1 his
1 pipe
1 and
1 smoked
1 from
1 the
1 time
1 when
1 the
1 evening
1 mists
1 began
1 to
1 rise
1 until
1 he
1 went
1 to
1 bed
1 The
1 time
1 passed
1 very
1 slowly
1 The
1 cries
1 of
1 wild
1 creatures
1 could
1 be
1 heard
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 and
1 although
1 Frank
1 did
1 not
1 expect
1 to
1 be
1 attacked
1 it
1 was
1 impossible
1 to
1 sleep
1 with
1 these
1 calls
1 of
1 leopards
1 with
1 which
1 the
1 forest
1 seemed
1 to
1 abound
1 in
1 his
1 ears
1 He
1 had
1 reloaded
1 his
1 revolver
1 immediately
1 after
1 discharging
1 it
1 and
1 had
1 replaced
1 it
1 in
1 his
1 pouch
1 and
1 felt
1 confident
1 that
1 nothing
1 could
1 climb
1 the
1 tree
1 Besides
1 he
1 had
1 heard
1 that
1 leopards
1 seldom
1 attack
1 men
1 unless
1 themselves
1 attacked
1 Sleep
1 however
1 was
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 question
1 for
1 when
1 he
1 slept
1 he
1 might
1 have
1 fallen
1 from
1 his
1 seat
1 in
1 the
1 crotch
1 of
1 the
1 tree
1 Occasionally
1 however
1 he
1 dozed
1 off
1 waking
1 up
1 always
1 with
1 an
1 uncomfortable
1 start
1 and
1 a
1 feeling
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 just
1 saved
1 himself
1 from
1 falling
1 ith
1 the
1 earliest
1 dawn
1 of
1 morn
1 he
1 descended
1 stiff
1 and
1 weary
1 from
1 the
1 tree
1 Directly
1 the
1 sun
1 rose
1 he
1 set
1 off
1 walking
1 He
1 knew
1 at
1 least
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 to
1 the
1 south
1 of
1 the
1 camp
1 and
1 that
1 by
1 keeping
1 the
1 sun
1 on
1 his
1 right
1 hand
1 till
1 it
1 reached
1 the
1 zenith
1 he
1 must
1 get
1 in
1 time
1 to
1 the
1 little
1 stream
1 on
1 which
1 it
1 was
1 pitched
1 As
1 he
1 walked
1 he
1 listened
1 intently
1 for
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 guns
1 Once
1 or
1 twice
1 he
1 fancied
1 that
1 he
1 heard
1 them
1 but
1 he
1 was
1 quite
1 unable
1 to
1 judge
1 of
1 the
1 direction
1 He
1 had
1 been
1 out
1 with
1 the
1 Houssa
1 about
1 six
1 hours
1 before
1 he
1 strayed
1 from
1 him
1 in
1 the
1 pursuit
1 of
1 the
1 butterfly
1 and
1 they
1 had
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 been
1 walking
1 towards
1 the
1 camp
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 reach
1 it
1 by
1 nightfall
1 Thus
1 he
1 thought
1 that
1 at
1 that
1 time
1 he
1 could
1 only
1 have
1 been
1 some
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 miles
1 distant
1 from
1 it
1 Supposing
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 run
1 due
1 south
1 he
1 could
1 still
1 be
1 but
1 eight
1 miles
1 from
1 the
1 stream
1 and
1 he
1 thought
1 that
1 in
1 three
1 hours
1 walking
1 he
1 might
1 arrive
1 there
1 In
1 point
1 of
1 fact
1 after
1 leaving
1 the
1 Houssa
1 the
1 butterfly
1 had
1 led
1 him
1 towards
1 the
1 southeast
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 stream
1 took
1 a
1 sharp
1 bend
1 to
1 the
1 north
1 a
1 little
1 distance
1 above
1 the
1 camp
1 he
1 was
1 many
1 miles
1 farther
1 from
1 it
1 than
1 he
1 expected
1 This
1 stream
1 was
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 upper
1 tributaries
1 of
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 After
1 walking
1 for
1 two
1 hours
1 the
1 character
1 of
1 the
1 forest
1 changed
1 The
1 high
1 trees
1 were
1 farther
1 apart
1 and
1 a
1 thick
1 undergrowth
1 began
1 to
1 make
1 its
1 appearance
1 frequently
1 causing
1 him
1 to
1 make
1 long
1 detours
1 and
1 preventing
1 his
1 following
1 the
1 line
1 he
1 had
1 marked
1 out
1 for
1 himself
1 This
1 caused
1 him
1 much
1 uneasiness
1 for
1 he
1 knew
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 passed
1 across
1 no
1 such
1 country
1 on
1 his
1 way
1 from
1 the
1 camp
1 and
1 the
1 thought
1 that
1 he
1 might
1 experience
1 great
1 difficulties
1 in
1 recovering
1 it
1 now
1 began
1 to
1 press
1 upon
1 him
1 CHAPTER
1 XI
1 A
1 HOSTILE
1 TRIBE
1 Every
1 step
1 that
1 he
1 went
1 the
1 ground
1 grew
1 softer
1 and
1 more
1 swampy
1 and
1 he
1 at
1 length
1 determined
1 to
1 push
1 on
1 no
1 farther
1 in
1 this
1 direction
1 but
1 turning
1 to
1 his
1 left
1 to
1 try
1 and
1 gain
1 higher
1 ground
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 continue
1 on
1 the
1 line
1 he
1 had
1 marked
1 out
1 for
1 himself
1 His
1 progress
1 was
1 now
1 very
1 slow
1 The
1 bush
1 was
1 thick
1 and
1 close
1 thorny
1 plants
1 and
1 innumerable
1 creepers
1 continually
1 barred
1 his
1 way
1 and
1 the
1 necessity
1 for
1 constantly
1 looking
1 up
1 through
1 the
1 trees
1 to
1 catch
1 a
1 glimpse
1 of
1 the
1 sun
1 which
1 was
1 his
1 only
1 guide
1 added
1 to
1 his
1 difficulty
1 At
1 length
1 when
1 his
1 watch
1 told
1 him
1 it
1 was
1 eleven
1 o
1 clock
1 he
1 came
1 to
1 a
1 standstill
1 the
1 sun
1 being
1 too
1 high
1 overhead
1 to
1 serve
1 him
1 as
1 a
1 reliable
1 guide
1 He
1 had
1 now
1 been
1 walking
1 for
1 nearly
1 six
1 hours
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 utterly
1 worn
1 out
1 and
1 exhausted
1 having
1 had
1 no
1 food
1 since
1 his
1 midday
1 meal
1 on
1 the
1 previous
1 day
1 He
1 was
1 devoured
1 with
1 thirst
1 having
1 merely
1 rinsed
1 his
1 mouth
1 in
1 the
1 black
1 and
1 poisonous
1 water
1 of
1 the
1 swamps
1 he
1 had
1 crossed
1 His
1 sleepless
1 night
1 too
1 had
1 told
1 on
1 him
1 He
1 was
1 bathed
1 in
1 perspiration
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 last
1 hour
1 had
1 scarcely
1 been
1 able
1 to
1 drag
1 his
1 feet
1 along
1 He
1 now
1 lay
1 down
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 a
1 great
1 tree
1 and
1 for
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 hours
1 slept
1 heavily
1 hen
1 he
1 awoke
1 he
1 pursued
1 his
1 journey
1 the
1 sun
1 serving
1 as
1 a
1 guide
1 again
1 In
1 two
1 hours
1 time
1 he
1 had
1 got
1 upon
1 higher
1 ground
1 The
1 brushwood
1 was
1 less
1 dense
1 and
1 he
1 again
1 turned
1 his
1 face
1 to
1 the
1 north
1 and
1 stepped
1 forward
1 with
1 renewed
1 hopes
1 It
1 was
1 late
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 when
1 he
1 came
1 upon
1 a
1 native
1 path
1 Here
1 he
1 sat
1 down
1 to
1 think
1 He
1 did
1 not
1 remember
1 having
1 crossed
1 such
1 a
1 path
1 on
1 the
1 day
1 before
1 Probably
1 it
1 crossed
1 the
1 stream
1 at
1 some
1 point
1 above
1 the
1 encampment
1 Therefore
1 it
1 would
1 serve
1 as
1 a
1 guide
1 and
1 he
1 might
1 too
1 come
1 upon
1 some
1 native
1 village
1 where
1 he
1 could
1 procure
1 food
1 By
1 following
1 it
1 far
1 enough
1 he
1 must
1 arrive
1 somewhere
1 He
1 sat
1 for
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 to
1 rest
1 himself
1 and
1 then
1 proceeded
1 along
1 the
1 path
1 whose
1 direction
1 seemed
1 to
1 be
1 the
1 northwest
1 For
1 an
1 hour
1 he
1 proceeded
1 and
1 then
1 paused
1 hearing
1 a
1 sudden
1 outcry
1 ahead
1 Scampering
1 along
1 the
1 path
1 came
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 great
1 baboons
1 and
1 Frank
1 at
1 once
1 stepped
1 aside
1 into
1 the
1 bush
1 to
1 avoid
1 them
1 as
1 these
1 are
1 formidable
1 creatures
1 when
1 disturbed
1 They
1 were
1 of
1 a
1 very
1 large
1 species
1 and
1 several
1 of
1 the
1 females
1 had
1 little
1 ones
1 clinging
1 around
1 their
1 necks
1 In
1 the
1 distance
1 Frank
1 could
1 hear
1 the
1 shouts
1 of
1 some
1 natives
1 and
1 supposed
1 that
1 the
1 monkeys
1 had
1 been
1 plundering
1 their
1 plantations
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 driving
1 them
1 away
1 The
1 baboons
1 passed
1 without
1 paying
1 any
1 attention
1 to
1 him
1 but
1 Frank
1 observed
1 that
1 the
1 last
1 of
1 the
1 troop
1 was
1 carrying
1 a
1 little
1 one
1 in
1 one
1 of
1 its
1 forearms
1 Frank
1 glanced
1 at
1 the
1 baby
1 monkey
1 and
1 saw
1 that
1 it
1 had
1 round
1 its
1 waist
1 a
1 string
1 of
1 blue
1 beads
1 As
1 a
1 string
1 of
1 beads
1 is
1 the
1 only
1 attire
1 which
1 a
1 negro
1 child
1 wears
1 until
1 it
1 reaches
1 the
1 age
1 of
1 ten
1 or
1 eleven
1 years
1 old
1 the
1 truth
1 at
1 once
1 flashed
1 upon
1 Frank
1 that
1 the
1 baboons
1 were
1 carrying
1 off
1 a
1 native
1 baby
1 which
1 had
1 probably
1 been
1 set
1 down
1 by
1 its
1 mother
1 while
1 she
1 worked
1 in
1 the
1 plantation
1 Instantly
1 he
1 drew
1 his
1 pistol
1 leaped
1 into
1 the
1 road
1 and
1 fired
1 at
1 the
1 retreating
1 ape
1 It
1 gave
1 a
1 cry
1 dropped
1 the
1 baby
1 and
1 turned
1 to
1 attack
1 its
1 aggressor
1 Frank
1 waited
1 till
1 it
1 was
1 within
1 six
1 feet
1 and
1 then
1 shot
1 it
1 through
1 the
1 head
1 He
1 sprang
1 forward
1 and
1 seized
1 the
1 baby
1 but
1 in
1 a
1 moment
1 he
1 was
1 attacked
1 by
1 the
1 whole
1 party
1 of
1 baboons
1 who
1 barking
1 like
1 dogs
1 and
1 uttering
1 angry
1 cries
1 rushed
1 at
1 him
1 Frank
1 stood
1 his
1 ground
1 and
1 discharged
1 the
1 four
1 remaining
1 barrels
1 of
1 his
1 revolver
1 at
1 the
1 foremost
1 animals
1 Two
1 of
1 these
1 dropped
1 but
1 the
1 others
1 who
1 were
1 only
1 wounded
1 sprang
1 upon
1 him
1 Frank
1 struck
1 out
1 with
1 the
1 butt
1 end
1 of
1 his
1 pistol
1 but
1 in
1 a
1 minute
1 he
1 was
1 overpowered
1 One
1 monkey
1 seized
1 him
1 by
1 the
1 leg
1 with
1 his
1 teeth
1 while
1 another
1 bit
1 his
1 arm
1 Others
1 struck
1 and
1 scratched
1 at
1 him
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 thrown
1 down
1 He
1 tried
1 to
1 defend
1 his
1 face
1 with
1 his
1 arms
1 kicking
1 and
1 struggling
1 to
1 the
1 best
1 of
1 his
1 power
1 ith
1 one
1 hand
1 he
1 drew
1 the
1 long
1 knife
1 for
1 skinning
1 animals
1 which
1 he
1 wore
1 at
1 his
1 belt
1 and
1 struck
1 out
1 fiercely
1 but
1 a
1 baboon
1 seized
1 his
1 wrist
1 in
1 its
1 teeth
1 and
1 Frank
1 felt
1 that
1 all
1 was
1 over
1 when
1 suddenly
1 his
1 assailants
1 left
1 him
1 and
1 the
1 instant
1 afterwards
1 he
1 was
1 lifted
1 to
1 his
1 feet
1 by
1 some
1 negroes
1 He
1 had
1 when
1 attacked
1 by
1 the
1 apes
1 thrown
1 the
1 baby
1 into
1 a
1 clump
1 of
1 ferns
1 close
1 by
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 have
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 both
1 his
1 hands
1 and
1 when
1 he
1 looked
1 round
1 he
1 found
1 that
1 a
1 negress
1 had
1 already
1 picked
1 it
1 up
1 and
1 was
1 crying
1 and
1 fondling
1 it
1 The
1 negroes
1 appeared
1 intensely
1 astonished
1 at
1 Frank
1 s
1 color
1 and
1 he
1 judged
1 by
1 their
1 exclamations
1 of
1 surprise
1 that
1 not
1 only
1 had
1 they
1 not
1 seen
1 a
1 white
1 man
1 before
1 but
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 not
1 heard
1 of
1 one
1 being
1 in
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 Frank
1 had
1 been
1 too
1 severely
1 bitten
1 and
1 mauled
1 by
1 the
1 baboons
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 walk
1 and
1 the
1 negroes
1 seeing
1 this
1 raised
1 him
1 and
1 four
1 of
1 them
1 carried
1 him
1 to
1 their
1 village
1 which
1 was
1 but
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 a
1 mile
1 distant
1 Here
1 he
1 was
1 taken
1 to
1 the
1 principal
1 hut
1 and
1 laid
1 on
1 a
1 bed
1 His
1 wounds
1 were
1 dressed
1 with
1 poultices
1 formed
1 of
1 bruised
1 leaves
1 of
1 some
1 plant
1 the
1 natives
1 evincing
1 the
1 utmost
1 astonishment
1 as
1 Frank
1 removed
1 his
1 clothes
1 to
1 enable
1 these
1 operations
1 to
1 be
1 performed
1 By
1 pointing
1 to
1 his
1 lips
1 he
1 indicated
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 hungry
1 and
1 thirsty
1 ater
1 was
1 brought
1 to
1 him
1 and
1 cakes
1 made
1 from
1 pounded
1 yams
1 pressed
1 and
1 baked
1 Having
1 eaten
1 and
1 drank
1 he
1 closed
1 his
1 eyes
1 and
1 lay
1 back
1 and
1 the
1 natives
1 who
1 had
1 before
1 been
1 all
1 noisily
1 chattering
1 together
1 now
1 became
1 suddenly
1 silent
1 and
1 stealing
1 away
1 left
1 the
1 strange
1 white
1 visitor
1 to
1 sleep
1 hen
1 Frank
1 woke
1 he
1 could
1 see
1 by
1 the
1 light
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 early
1 morning
1 A
1 woman
1 with
1 a
1 child
1 in
1 her
1 lap
1 whom
1 Frank
1 recognized
1 as
1 the
1 negress
1 who
1 had
1 picked
1 up
1 the
1 baby
1 was
1 sitting
1 on
1 a
1 low
1 stool
1 by
1 his
1 side
1 On
1 seeing
1 him
1 open
1 his
1 eyes
1 she
1 came
1 to
1 the
1 bed
1 took
1 his
1 hand
1 and
1 put
1 it
1 to
1 her
1 lips
1 and
1 then
1 raised
1 the
1 baby
1 triumphantly
1 and
1 turned
1 it
1 round
1 and
1 round
1 to
1 show
1 that
1 it
1 had
1 escaped
1 without
1 damage
1 Then
1 when
1 Frank
1 pointed
1 again
1 to
1 his
1 lips
1 she
1 brought
1 him
1 a
1 pineapple
1 roughly
1 cut
1 off
1 the
1 skin
1 and
1 sliced
1 it
1 Frank
1 ate
1 the
1 juicy
1 fruit
1 and
1 felt
1 immensely
1 refreshed
1 for
1 the
1 est
1 Coast
1 pineapple
1 is
1 even
1 more
1 delicious
1 than
1 that
1 found
1 in
1 the
1 est
1 Indies
1 Then
1 the
1 woman
1 removed
1 the
1 bandages
1 and
1 applied
1 fresh
1 poultices
1 to
1 his
1 wounds
1 talking
1 in
1 low
1 soft
1 tones
1 and
1 as
1 Frank
1 had
1 no
1 doubt
1 expressing
1 sorrow
1 at
1 their
1 cause
1 Frank
1 now
1 endeavored
1 to
1 explain
1 to
1 her
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 a
1 white
1 companion
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 but
1 the
1 woman
1 not
1 understanding
1 brought
1 in
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 other
1 natives
1 who
1 stood
1 round
1 the
1 couch
1 and
1 endeavored
1 to
1 gather
1 what
1 he
1 wished
1 to
1 say
1 Frank
1 held
1 up
1 two
1 fingers
1 Then
1 he
1 pointed
1 to
1 himself
1 and
1 shut
1 down
1 one
1 finger
1 keeping
1 the
1 other
1 erect
1 and
1 then
1 pointed
1 all
1 round
1 to
1 signify
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 a
1 friend
1 somewhere
1 in
1 the
1 wood
1 A
1 grin
1 of
1 comprehension
1 stole
1 over
1 the
1 faces
1 of
1 the
1 negroes
1 and
1 Frank
1 saw
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 understood
1 Then
1 he
1 again
1 held
1 up
1 his
1 two
1 fingers
1 and
1 taking
1 the
1 hands
1 of
1 the
1 negress
1 raised
1 all
1 her
1 fingers
1 by
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 ones
1 to
1 signify
1 that
1 there
1 were
1 many
1 natives
1 with
1 them
1 Then
1 he
1 took
1 aim
1 with
1 an
1 imaginary
1 gun
1 up
1 at
1 the
1 roof
1 of
1 the
1 hut
1 and
1 said
1 Bang
1 very
1 loud
1 and
1 a
1 chorus
1 of
1 approving
1 laughter
1 from
1 the
1 negroes
1 showed
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 understood
1 Then
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 pointed
1 towards
1 the
1 various
1 points
1 of
1 the
1 compass
1 and
1 looked
1 interrogatively
1 at
1 Frank
1 The
1 sun
1 was
1 streaming
1 in
1 through
1 the
1 doorway
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 thus
1 able
1 to
1 judge
1 of
1 the
1 direction
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 camp
1 must
1 lie
1 He
1 made
1 a
1 sweep
1 with
1 his
1 hand
1 towards
1 the
1 northwest
1 signifying
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 somewhere
1 in
1 that
1 direction
1 That
1 afternoon
1 fever
1 set
1 in
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 two
1 next
1 days
1 Frank
1 was
1 delirious
1 hen
1 he
1 recovered
1 consciousness
1 he
1 found
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 sitting
1 beside
1 him
1 The
1 latter
1 would
1 not
1 suffer
1 him
1 to
1 talk
1 but
1 gave
1 him
1 a
1 strong
1 dose
1 of
1 quinine
1 and
1 told
1 him
1 to
1 lie
1 quiet
1 and
1 go
1 to
1 sleep
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 till
1 the
1 next
1 day
1 that
1 Frank
1 learned
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 in
1 his
1 absence
1 The
1 Houssa
1 had
1 not
1 returned
1 until
1 long
1 after
1 nightfall
1 He
1 reported
1 that
1 Frank
1 had
1 told
1 him
1 to
1 wait
1 with
1 the
1 guns
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 waited
1 until
1 it
1 grew
1 nearly
1 dark
1 Then
1 he
1 had
1 fired
1 several
1 times
1 and
1 had
1 walked
1 about
1 firing
1 his
1 gun
1 at
1 intervals
1 Obtaining
1 no
1 responses
1 he
1 had
1 made
1 his
1 way
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 where
1 his
1 arrival
1 alone
1 caused
1 great
1 consternation
1 It
1 was
1 impossible
1 to
1 do
1 anything
1 that
1 night
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 morning
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 accompanied
1 by
1 five
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 one
1 only
1 remaining
1 to
1 keep
1 guard
1 over
1 the
1 camp
1 had
1 gone
1 to
1 the
1 place
1 where
1 Frank
1 had
1 last
1 been
1 seen
1 Then
1 they
1 scattered
1 in
1 various
1 directions
1 shouting
1 and
1 firing
1 their
1 guns
1 The
1 search
1 had
1 been
1 continued
1 all
1 day
1 without
1 success
1 and
1 at
1 nightfall
1 disheartened
1 and
1 worn
1 out
1 they
1 had
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 the
1 search
1 had
1 been
1 continued
1 with
1 an
1 equal
1 want
1 of
1 success
1 and
1 the
1 fears
1 that
1 a
1 leopard
1 had
1 attacked
1 and
1 killed
1 Frank
1 became
1 stronger
1 and
1 stronger
1 On
1 the
1 third
1 day
1 the
1 whole
1 of
1 the
1 carriers
1 were
1 sent
1 out
1 with
1 instructions
1 to
1 search
1 the
1 woods
1 for
1 native
1 paths
1 to
1 follow
1 these
1 to
1 villages
1 and
1 to
1 enlist
1 the
1 natives
1 in
1 the
1 search
1 One
1 of
1 these
1 men
1 had
1 met
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 villagers
1 on
1 the
1 search
1 for
1 the
1 party
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 man
1 It
1 was
1 another
1 ten
1 days
1 before
1 Frank
1 was
1 sufficiently
1 recovered
1 from
1 his
1 fever
1 and
1 wounds
1 to
1 march
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 After
1 a
1 stay
1 there
1 of
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 more
1 days
1 to
1 enable
1 him
1 completely
1 to
1 regain
1 his
1 strength
1 the
1 party
1 started
1 again
1 on
1 their
1 journey
1 In
1 another
1 three
1 weeks
1 they
1 had
1 descended
1 the
1 hills
1 and
1 the
1 Fans
1 announced
1 their
1 unwillingness
1 to
1 travel
1 farther
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 however
1 told
1 them
1 quietly
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 promised
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 until
1 he
1 could
1 obtain
1 other
1 carriers
1 and
1 that
1 if
1 they
1 deserted
1 him
1 he
1 should
1 pay
1 them
1 nothing
1 They
1 might
1 now
1 expect
1 every
1 day
1 to
1 meet
1 people
1 of
1 another
1 tribe
1 and
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 they
1 should
1 do
1 so
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 allowed
1 to
1 depart
1 Finding
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 firm
1 and
1 having
1 no
1 desire
1 to
1 forfeit
1 the
1 wages
1 they
1 had
1 earned
1 the
1 Fans
1 agreed
1 to
1 go
1 forward
1 although
1 they
1 were
1 now
1 in
1 a
1 country
1 entirely
1 unknown
1 to
1 them
1 where
1 the
1 people
1 would
1 presumably
1 be
1 hostile
1 They
1 had
1 however
1 such
1 faith
1 in
1 the
1 arms
1 carried
1 by
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 and
1 Houssas
1 that
1 they
1 felt
1 comparatively
1 easy
1 as
1 to
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 any
1 attack
1 which
1 might
1 be
1 made
1 upon
1 them
1 The
1 very
1 day
1 after
1 this
1 little
1 mutiny
1 smoke
1 was
1 seen
1 curling
1 up
1 from
1 the
1 woods
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 deemed
1 it
1 inexpedient
1 to
1 show
1 himself
1 at
1 once
1 with
1 so
1 large
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 men
1 He
1 therefore
1 sent
1 forward
1 Ostik
1 with
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 each
1 of
1 whom
1 could
1 speak
1 several
1 native
1 dialects
1 to
1 announce
1 his
1 coming
1 They
1 returned
1 in
1 an
1 hour
1 saying
1 that
1 the
1 village
1 was
1 a
1 very
1 large
1 one
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 news
1 of
1 the
1 coming
1 of
1 two
1 white
1 men
1 had
1 created
1 great
1 excitement
1 The
1 people
1 spoke
1 of
1 sending
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 their
1 king
1 whom
1 they
1 called
1 Malembe
1 whose
1 place
1 it
1 seemed
1 was
1 a
1 day
1 s
1 march
1 off
1 They
1 now
1 prepared
1 to
1 enter
1 the
1 village
1 Ostik
1 went
1 first
1 carrying
1 himself
1 with
1 the
1 dignity
1 of
1 a
1 beadle
1 at
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 a
1 school
1 procession
1 Two
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 walked
1 next
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 followed
1 their
1 guns
1 being
1 carried
1 by
1 two
1 Fans
1 behind
1 them
1 Then
1 came
1 the
1 long
1 line
1 of
1 bearers
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 walking
1 on
1 each
1 side
1 as
1 a
1 baggage
1 guard
1 The
1 villagers
1 assembled
1 in
1 great
1 numbers
1 as
1 they
1 entered
1 The
1 head
1 man
1 conducted
1 the
1 whites
1 to
1 his
1 hut
1 No
1 women
1 or
1 children
1 were
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 and
1 the
1 expression
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 was
1 that
1 of
1 fear
1 rather
1 than
1 curiosity
1 They
1 are
1 afraid
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 The
1 other
1 tribes
1 all
1 have
1 a
1 species
1 of
1 terror
1 of
1 these
1 cannibals
1 e
1 must
1 reassure
1 them
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 possible
1 A
1 long
1 palaver
1 then
1 took
1 place
1 with
1 the
1 chief
1 with
1 whose
1 language
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 was
1 sufficiently
1 acquainted
1 to
1 make
1 himself
1 understood
1 It
1 was
1 rather
1 a
1 tedious
1 business
1 as
1 each
1 speech
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 translated
1 twice
1 through
1 Ostik
1 and
1 the
1 Fan
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 informed
1 the
1 chief
1 that
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 were
1 friends
1 of
1 his
1 people
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 come
1 to
1 see
1 the
1 country
1 and
1 give
1 presents
1 to
1 the
1 chiefs
1 that
1 they
1 only
1 wished
1 to
1 pass
1 quietly
1 through
1 and
1 to
1 journey
1 unmolested
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 pay
1 handsomely
1 for
1 food
1 and
1 all
1 that
1 they
1 required
1 They
1 wished
1 to
1 obtain
1 bearers
1 for
1 their
1 baggage
1 and
1 these
1 they
1 would
1 pay
1 in
1 cloth
1 and
1 brass
1 rods
1 and
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 they
1 procured
1 carriers
1 the
1 Fans
1 would
1 return
1 to
1 their
1 own
1 country
1 The
1 chief
1 answered
1 expressing
1 his
1 gratification
1 at
1 seeing
1 white
1 men
1 in
1 his
1 village
1 saying
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 would
1 no
1 doubt
1 carry
1 out
1 all
1 their
1 wishes
1 One
1 of
1 the
1 boxes
1 was
1 opened
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 presented
1 with
1 five
1 yards
1 of
1 bright
1 colored
1 calico
1 a
1 gaudy
1 silk
1 handkerchief
1 and
1 several
1 strings
1 of
1 bright
1 beads
1 In
1 return
1 a
1 large
1 number
1 of
1 plantains
1 were
1 presented
1 to
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 These
1 were
1 soon
1 distributed
1 among
1 the
1 Fans
1 Me
1 no
1 like
1 dat

1 Ostik
1 said
1 Me

1 when

1 That
1 day
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 passed
1 quietly
1 The
1 baggage
1 had
1 been
1 piled
1 in
1 a
1 circle
1 as
1 usual
1 in
1 an
1 open
1 space
1 outside
1 the
1 village
1 the
1 tent
1 being
1 pitched
1 in
1 the
1 center
1 and
1 Ostik
1 advised
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 to
1 sleep
1 here
1 instead
1 of
1 in
1 the
1 village
1 The
1 day
1 after
1 their
1 arrival
1 passed
1 but
1 heavily
1 The
1 natives
1 showed
1 but
1 little
1 curiosity
1 as
1 to
1 the
1 newcomers
1 although
1 these
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 far
1 more
1 strange
1 to

1 people
1 nearer
1 the

1 Still
1 no
1 women
1 or
1 children
1 made
1 their
1 appearance
1 Towards
1 evening
1 a
1 great
1 drumming
1 was
1 heard
1 in
1 the
1 distance
1 Here
1 is
1 his
1 majesty
1 at
1 last
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 we
1 shall
1 soon
1 see
1 what
1 is
1 his
1 disposition
1 In
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 the
1 village
1 was
1 filled
1 with
1 a
1 crowd
1 of
1 men
1 all
1 carrying
1 spears
1 and
1 bows
1 and
1 arrows
1 The
1 drumming
1 came
1 nearer
1 and
1 nearer
1 and
1 then
1 carried
1 in
1 a
1 chair
1 on
1 the
1 shoulders
1 of
1 four
1 strong
1 negroes
1 while
1 ten
1 others
1 armed
1 with
1 guns
1 marched
1 beside
1 him
1 the
1 king
1 made
1 his
1 appearance
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 advanced
1 to
1 meet
1 him
1 The
1 king
1 was
1 a
1 tall
1 man
1 with
1 a
1 savage
1 expression
1 of
1 countenance
1 Behind
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Ostik
1 and
1 the
1 Fan
1 who
1 spoke
1 the
1 language
1 advanced
1 The
1 king
1 s
1 chair
1 was
1 lowered
1 under
1 the
1 shade
1 of
1 a
1 tree
1 and
1 two
1 attendants
1 with
1 palm
1 leaf
1 fans
1 at
1 once
1 began
1 to
1 fan
1 his
1 majesty
1 Tell
1 the
1 king
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 that
1 we
1 are
1 white
1 men
1 who
1 have
1 come
1 to
1 see
1 his
1 country
1 and
1 to
1 pass
1 through
1 to
1 the
1 countries
1 beyond
1 e
1 have
1 many
1 presents
1 for
1 him
1 and
1 wish
1 to
1 buy
1 food
1 and
1 to
1 hire
1 carriers
1 in
1 place
1 of
1 those
1 who
1 have
1 brought
1 our
1 things
1 thus
1 far
1 The
1 king
1 listened
1 in
1 silence
1 hy
1 do
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 bring
1 our
1 enemies
1 into
1 our
1 land
1 he
1 asked
1 angrily
1 e
1 have
1 come
1 up
1 from
1 the
1 coast
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 and
1 as
1 we
1 passed
1 through
1 the
1 Fan
1 country
1 we
1 hired
1 men
1 there
1 to
1 carry
1 our
1 goods
1 just
1 as
1 we
1 wish
1 to
1 hire
1 men
1 here
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 into
1 the
1 country
1 beyond
1 There
1 were
1 none
1 of
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 men
1 in
1 that
1 country
1 or
1 we
1 would
1 have
1 hired
1 them
1 Let
1 me
1 see
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 s
1 presents
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 A
1 box
1 was
1 opened
1 a
1 bright
1 scarlet
1 shirt
1 and
1 a
1 smoking
1 cap
1 of
1 the
1 same
1 color
1 worked
1 with
1 beads
1 a
1 blue
1 silk
1 handkerchief
1 and
1 twenty
1 yards
1 of
1 bright
1 calico
1 were
1 taken
1 out
1 To
1 these
1 were
1 added
1 twelve
1 stair
1 rods
1 five
1 pounds
1 of
1 powder
1 and
1 two
1 pounds
1 of
1 shot
1 The
1 king
1 s
1 eye
1 sparkled
1 greedily
1 as
1 he
1 looked
1 at
1 the
1 treasures
1 The
1 white
1 men
1 must
1 be
1 very
1 rich
1 he
1 said
1 pointing
1 to
1 the
1 pile
1 of
1 baggage
1 Most
1 of
1 the
1 boxes
1 are
1 empty
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 e
1 have
1 brought
1 them
1 to
1 take
1 home
1 the
1 things
1 of
1 the
1 country
1 and
1 show
1 them
1 to
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 beyond
1 the
1 sea
1 and
1 to
1 prove
1 the
1 truth
1 of
1 his
1 words
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 empty
1 cases
1 opened
1 as
1 also
1 one
1 already
1 half
1 filled
1 with
1 bird
1 skins
1 and
1 another
1 with
1 trays
1 of
1 butterflies
1 and
1 beetles
1 The
1 king
1 looked
1 at
1 them
1 with
1 surprise
1 And
1 the
1 others
1 he
1 asked
1 pointing
1 to
1 them
1 The
1 others
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 contain
1 some
1 of
1 them
1 food
1 such
1 as
1 white
1 men
1 are
1 accustomed
1 to
1 eat
1 in
1 their
1 own
1 country
1 the
1 others
1 presents
1 for
1 the
1 other
1 kings
1 and
1 chiefs
1 I
1 shall
1 meet
1 when
1 we
1 have
1 passed
1 on
1 The
1 fellow
1 is
1 not
1 satisfied
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 Ostik
1 give
1 him
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 trade
1 guns
1 and
1 a
1 bottle
1 of
1 brandy
1 The
1 king
1 appeared
1 mollified
1 by
1 these
1 additional
1 presents
1 and
1 saying
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 talk
1 to
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 he
1 retired
1 into
1 the
1 village
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 like
1 the
1 looks
1 of
1 things
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 I
1 fear
1 that
1 the
1 presents
1 we
1 have
1 given
1 the
1 king
1 will
1 only
1 stimulate
1 his
1 desire
1 for
1 more
1 However
1 we
1 shall
1 see
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 hen
1 night
1 fell
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 were
1 placed
1 on
1 guard
1 The
1 Fans
1 slept
1 inside
1 the
1 circle
1 formed
1 by
1 the
1 baggage
1 Several
1 times
1 in
1 the
1 night
1 the
1 Houssas
1 challenged
1 bodies
1 of
1 men
1 whom
1 they
1 heard
1 approaching
1 but
1 these
1 at
1 once
1 retired
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 a
1 messenger
1 presented
1 himself
1 from
1 the
1 king
1 saying
1 that
1 he
1 required
1 many
1 more
1 presents
1 that
1 the
1 things
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 given
1 were
1 only
1 fit
1 for
1 the
1 chief
1 of
1 a
1 village
1 and
1 not
1 for
1 a
1 great
1 king
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 given
1 the
1 best
1 he
1 had
1 that
1 the
1 presents
1 were
1 fit
1 for
1 a
1 great
1 king
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 give
1 no
1 more
1 If
1 we
1 are
1 to
1 have
1 trouble
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 it
1 is
1 far
1 better
1 to
1 have
1 it
1 at
1 once
1 while
1 the
1 Fans
1 are
1 with
1 us
1 than
1 when
1 we
1 are
1 alone
1 with
1 no
1 one
1 but
1 the
1 Houssas
1 and
1 the
1 subjects
1 of
1 this
1 man
1 The
1 Fans
1 will
1 fight
1 and
1 we
1 could
1 hold
1 this
1 encampment
1 against
1 any
1 number
1 of
1 savages
1 A
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 later
1 the
1 drums
1 began
1 beating
1 furiously
1 again
1 Loud
1 shouts
1 and
1 yells
1 arose
1 in
1 the
1 village
1 and
1 the
1 natives
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 moving
1 excitedly
1 about
1 Presently
1 these
1 all
1 disappeared
1 Fight
1 come
1 now
1 Ostik
1 said
1 You
1 d
1 better
1 lower
1 the
1 tent
1 at
1 once
1 Ostik
1 It
1 will
1 only
1 he
1 in
1 our
1 way
1 The
1 tent
1 was
1 speedily
1 lowered
1 The
1 Fans
1 grasped
1 their
1 spears
1 and
1 lay
1 down
1 behind
1 the
1 circle
1 of
1 boxes
1 and
1 bales
1 and
1 the
1 six
1 Houssas
1 the
1 two
1 white
1 men
1 and
1 Ostik
1 to
1 whom
1 a
1 trade
1 musket
1 had
1 been
1 entrusted
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 at
1 regular
1 intervals
1 round
1 the
1 circle
1 which
1 was
1 some
1 eight
1 yards
1 in
1 diameter
1 Presently
1 the
1 beat
1 of
1 the
1 drums
1 again
1 broke
1 the
1 silence
1 and
1 a
1 shower
1 of
1 arrows
1 coming
1 apparently
1 from
1 all
1 points
1 of
1 the
1 compass
1 fell
1 in
1 and
1 around
1 the
1 circle
1 Open
1 fire
1 steadily
1 and
1 quietly
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 among
1 the
1 bushes
1 but
1 don
1 t
1 fire
1 fast
1 e
1 must
1 tempt
1 them
1 to
1 show
1 themselves
1 A
1 dropping
1 fire
1 commenced
1 against
1 the
1 invisible
1 foe
1 the
1 fire
1 being
1 no
1 more
1 frequent
1 than
1 it
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 had
1 they
1 been
1 armed
1 with
1 muzzle
1 loading
1 weapons
1 Presently
1 musketry
1 was
1 heard
1 on
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 side
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 bodyguard
1 having
1 opened
1 fire
1 This
1 was
1 disastrous
1 to
1 them
1 for
1 whereas
1 the
1 arrows
1 had
1 afforded
1 but
1 slight
1 index
1 as
1 to
1 the
1 position
1 of
1 those
1 who
1 shot
1 them
1 the
1 puffs
1 of
1 smoke
1 from
1 the
1 muskets
1 at
1 once
1 showed
1 the
1 lurking
1 places
1 of
1 those
1 who
1 used
1 them
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 replied
1 so
1 truly
1 that
1 in
1 a
1 very
1 short
1 time
1 the
1 musketry
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 ceased
1 altogether
1 The
1 rain
1 of
1 arrows
1 continued
1 the
1 yells
1 of
1 the
1 natives
1 rose
1 louder
1 and
1 louder
1 and
1 the
1 drums
1 beat
1 more
1 furiously
1 They
1 will
1 be
1 out
1 directly
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 Fire
1 as
1 quickly
1 as
1 you
1 can
1 when
1 they
1 show
1 but
1 be
1 sure
1 and
1 take
1 good
1 aim
1 Presently
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 a
1 war
1 horn
1 was
1 heard
1 and
1 from
1 the
1 wood
1 all
1 round
1 a
1 crowd
1 of
1 dark
1 figures
1 dashed
1 forward
1 uttering
1 appalling
1 yells
1 On
1 the
1 instant
1 the
1 dropping
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 defenders
1 changed
1 into
1 an
1 almost
1 continuous
1 fusillade
1 as
1 the
1 Sniders
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 the
1 breech
1 loading
1 rifle
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 the
1 repeating
1 inchester
1 of
1 Frank
1 were
1 brought
1 into
1 play
1 at
1 their
1 full
1 speed
1 Yells
1 of
1 astonishment
1 broke
1 from
1 the
1 natives
1 and
1 a
1 minute
1 later
1 leaving
1 nearly
1 a
1 score
1 of
1 their
1 comrades
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 the
1 rest
1 dashed
1 back
1 into
1 the
1 forest
1 There
1 was
1 silence
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 and
1 then
1 the
1 war
1 drums
1 began
1 again
1 Dey
1 try
1 again
1 hard
1 dis
1 time
1 massa
1 Ostik
1 said
1 King
1 tell
1 em
1 he
1 cut
1 off
1 deir
1 heads
1 dey
1 not
1 win
1 battle
1 This
1 time
1 the
1 natives
1 rushed
1 forward
1 with
1 reckless
1 bravery
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 execution
1 made
1 among
1 them
1 by
1 the
1 rapid
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 defenders
1 and
1 rushed
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 circle
1 of
1 boxes
1 Then
1 the
1 Fans
1 leaped
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 and
1 spear
1 in
1 hand
1 dashed
1 over
1 the
1 defenses
1 and
1 fell
1 upon
1 the
1 enemy
1 The
1 attack
1 was
1 decisive
1 Uttering
1 yells
1 of
1 terror
1 the
1 natives
1 fled
1 and
1 two
1 minutes
1 later
1 not
1 a
1 sound
1 was
1 to
1 be
1 heard
1 in
1 the
1 forest
1 I
1 tink
1 dey
1 run
1 away
1 for
1 good
1 dis
1 time
1 sar
1 Ostik

1 Dey

1 Dey

1 very
1 brave
1 much
1 more
1 brave

1 Dere

1 great
1 battle
1 only
1 three
1 four
1 men
1 killed
1 Here
1 as
1 many
1 men
1 killed
1 as
1 we
1 got
1 altogether
1 This
1 was
1 so
1 nearly
1 fifty
1 of
1 the
1 natives
1 having
1 fallen
1 between
1 the
1 trees
1 and
1 the
1 encampment
1 hen
1 an
1 hour
1 passed
1 and
1 all
1 was
1 still
1 it
1 became
1 nearly
1 certain
1 that
1 the
1 enemy
1 had
1 retreated
1 and
1 the
1 Houssas
1 who
1 are
1 splendid
1 scouts
1 divested
1 themselves
1 of
1 their
1 clothing
1 and
1 crawled
1 away
1 into
1 the
1 wood
1 to
1 reconnoiter
1 They
1 returned
1 in
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 in
1 high
1 glee
1 bearing
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 chair
1 Dey

1 ebery
1 one
1 de

1 an
1 all
1 and
1 leab
1 his
1 chair
1 behind
1 Dat
1 great
1 disgrace
1 for
1 him
1 A
1 council
1 was
1 now
1 held
1 The
1 Fans
1 were
1 so
1 delighted
1 with
1 the
1 victory
1 they
1 had
1 won
1 that
1 they
1 expressed
1 their
1 readiness
1 to
1 remain
1 with
1 their
1 white
1 companions
1 as
1 long
1 as
1 they
1 chose
1 providing
1 these
1 would
1 guarantee
1 that
1 they
1 should
1 be
1 sent
1 home
1 on
1 the
1 expiration
1 of
1 their
1 service
1 This
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 readily
1 promised
1 After
1 discussing
1 the
1 question
1 with
1 Frank
1 he
1 determined
1 to
1 abstain
1 from
1 pushing
1 farther
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 but
1 to
1 keep
1 along
1 northward
1 and
1 then
1 turning
1 west
1 with
1 the
1 sweep
1 of
1 the
1 coast
1 to
1 travel
1 slowly
1 along
1 keeping
1 at
1 about
1 the
1 same
1 distance
1 as
1 at
1 present
1 from
1 the
1 sea
1 and
1 finally
1 to
1 come
1 down
1 either
1 upon
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 or
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 This
1 journey
1 would
1 occupy
1 a
1 considerable
1 time
1 They
1 would
1 cross
1 countries
1 but
1 little
1 known
1 and
1 would
1 have
1 an
1 ample
1 opportunity
1 for
1 the
1 collection
1 of
1 specimens
1 which
1 they
1 might
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 send
1 down
1 by
1 the
1 various
1 rivers
1 they
1 would
1 cross
1 to
1 the
1 trading
1 stations
1 at
1 their
1 mouths
1 It
1 was
1 felt
1 that
1 after
1 this
1 encounter
1 with
1 the
1 natives
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 imprudent
1 in
1 the
1 extreme
1 to
1 push
1 further
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 They
1 would
1 have
1 continual
1 battles
1 to
1 fight
1 large
1 numbers
1 of
1 the
1 natives
1 would
1 be
1 killed
1 and
1 their
1 collecting
1 operations
1 would
1 be
1 greatly
1 interfered
1 with
1 As
1 a
1 lesson
1 to
1 the
1 natives
1 the
1 village
1 was
1 burnt
1 to
1 the
1 ground
1 the
1 presents
1 which
1 the
1 king
1 in
1 the
1 hurry
1 of
1 his
1 flight
1 had
1 left
1 behind
1 him
1 being
1 recovered
1 A

1 and
1 a

1 Two

1 Mr

1 was
1 prostrated
1 by

1 and
1 for

1 days
1 lay
1 between
1 life
1 and
1 death
1 hen
1 he
1 became
1 convalescent
1 he
1 recovered
1 strength
1 very
1 slowly
1 The
1 heat
1 was
1 prodigious
1 and
1 the
1 mosquitos
1 rendered
1 sleep
1 almost
1 impossible
1 at
1 night
1 The
1 country
1 at
1 this
1 place
1 was
1 low
1 and
1 swampy
1 and
1 weak
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 determined
1 to
1 push
1 forward
1 He
1 was
1 however
1 unable
1 to
1 walk
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 first
1 time
1 a
1 hammock
1 was
1 got
1 out
1 and
1 mounted
1 There
1 is
1 no
1 more
1 comfortable
1 conveyance
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 than
1 a
1 hammock
1 in

1 It
1 is
1 slung
1 from
1 a
1 long
1 bamboo
1 pole
1 overhead
1 a

1 awning
1 keeps

1 Across

1 of

1 feet
1 long
1 are

1 The
1 natives
1 wrap
1 a
1 piece
1 of
1 cloth
1 into
1 the
1 shape
1 of
1 a
1 muffin
1 and
1 place
1 it
1 on
1 their

1 and
1 then
1 take
1 their
1 places
1 two
1 at
1 each
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 pole
1 with
1 the
1 ends
1 of
1 the

1 on

1 They
1 can
1 trot
1 along
1 at
1 the
1 rate
1 of
1 six
1 miles
1 an
1 hour
1 for
1 great
1 distances
1 often
1 keeping
1 up
1 a
1 monotonous
1 song
1 Their
1 action
1 is
1 perfectly
1 smooth
1 and
1 easy
1 and
1 the
1 traveler
1 in
1 the
1 hammock
1 by
1 shutting
1 his
1 eyes
1 might
1 imagine
1 himself
1 swinging
1 in
1 a
1 cot
1 on
1 board
1 ship
1 on
1 an
1 almost
1 waveless
1 sea
1 After
1 two
1 days
1 traveling
1 they
1 got
1 on
1 to
1 higher
1 ground
1 and
1 here
1 they
1 camped
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 slowly
1 recovering
1 strength
1 and
1 Frank
1 busy
1 in
1 adding
1 to

1 collections
1 In
1 this
1 he
1 was
1 in
1 no
1 slight
1 degree
1 assisted
1 by
1 the
1 Fans
1 who
1 having
1 nothing
1 else
1 to
1 do
1 had
1 now
1 come
1 to
1 enter
1 into
1 the
1 occupation
1 of
1 their
1 employers
1 A
1 good
1 supply
1 of
1 muslin
1 had
1 been
1 brought
1 and
1 nets
1 having
1 been
1 made
1 the
1 Fans
1 captured
1 large
1 quantities
1 of
1 butterflies
1 the
1 great
1 difficulty
1 being
1 in
1 convincing
1 them
1 that
1 only
1 a
1 few
1 of
1 each
1 species
1 were
1 required
1 They
1 were
1 still
1 more
1 valuable
1 in
1 grubbing
1 about
1 in
1 the
1 decaying
1 trunks
1 of
1 fallen
1 trees
1 under
1 loose
1 bark
1 and
1 in
1 broken
1 ground
1 for
1 beetles
1 and
1 larvae
1 a
1 task
1 which
1 suited
1 them
1 better
1 than
1 running
1 about
1 after
1 butterflies
1 which
1 moreover
1 they
1 often
1 spoilt
1 irreparably
1 by
1 their
1 rough
1 handling
1 Thus
1 Frank
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 devote
1 himself
1 entirely
1 to
1 the
1 pursuit
1 of
1 birds
1 and
1 although
1 all
1 the
1 varieties
1 more
1 usually
1 met

1 had
1 been
1 obtained
1 the
1 collection
1 steadily
1 increased
1 in
1 size
1 Frank
1 himself
1 had
1 severe
1 attacks
1 of
1 fever
1 but
1 none
1 of
1 these
1 were
1 so
1 severe
1 as
1 that

1 on

1 At

1 Two

1 After

1 The

1 was
1 indeed
1 for

1 extremely
1 late
1 but
1 the
1 time
1 had
1 passed
1 unheeded
1 so
1 interested
1 were
1 the
1 listeners
1 in
1 the
1 narrative
1 of
1 the
1 fine
1 old
1 negro
1 They
1 remained
1 at
1 the
1 village
1 for
1 a
1 week
1 and
1 were
1 greatly
1 pleased
1 with
1 the
1 industrious
1 habits
1 and
1 happy
1 appearance
1 of
1 the
1 people
1 and
1 with
1 the
1 earnestness
1 and
1 fervor
1 in
1 which
1 every
1 evening
1 and
1 twice
1 on
1 Sunday
1 they
1 joined
1 in
1 devotions
1 under
1 the
1 great
1 tree
1 At
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 that
1 time
1 they
1 said
1 goodbye
1 to
1 their
1 kind
1 host
1 giving
1 him
1 a
1 large
1 amount
1 of
1 cloth
1 for
1 distribution
1 among
1 his
1 people
1 He
1 was
1 unable
1 to
1 furnish
1 them
1 with
1 bearers
1 as
1 a
1 considerable
1 tract
1 of
1 uninhabited
1 country
1 extended
1 beyond
1 his
1 village
1 and
1 the
1 people
1 on
1 the
1 other
1 side
1 were
1 on
1 bad
1 terms
1 with
1 his
1 villagers
1 on
1 account
1 of
1 an
1 outstanding
1 feud
1 which
1 had
1 existed
1 long
1 before
1 his
1 return
1 from
1 America
1 and
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 in
1 vain
1 attempted
1 to
1 settle
1 since
1 he
1 assumed
1 the
1 headship
1 of
1 the
1 village
1 On
1 approaching
1 the
1 Niger
1 they
1 again
1 came
1 upon
1 an
1 inhabited
1 country
1 but
1 the
1 tribes
1 here
1 being
1 accustomed
1 to
1 trade
1 with
1 the
1 coast
1 were
1 friendly
1 and
1 at
1 the
1 first
1 large
1 village
1 they
1 came
1 to
1 no
1 difficulty
1 was
1 experienced
1 in
1 obtaining
1 a
1 fresh
1 relay
1 of
1 bearers
1 This
1 was
1 a
1 matter
1 of
1 great
1 satisfaction
1 for
1 the
1 Fans
1 were
1 regarded
1 with
1 extreme
1 antipathy
1 by
1 the
1 natives
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 arrangements
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 to
1 supply
1 their
1 place
1 the
1 Fans
1 were
1 paid
1 the
1 four
1 months
1 wages
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 earned
1 A
1 large
1 dash
1 of
1 beads
1 and
1 other
1 presents
1 were
1 bestowed
1 upon
1 them
1 three
1 of
1 the
1 remaining
1 sacks
1 of
1 rice
1 were
1 given
1 to
1 them
1 and
1 greatly
1 rejoicing
1 they
1 started
1 for
1 their
1 own
1 country
1 which
1 by
1 making
1 long
1 marches
1 they
1 would
1 regain
1 in
1 a
1 fortnight
1 s
1 time
1 Although
1 it
1 was
1 not
1 probable
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 meet
1 with
1 any
1 enemies
1 six
1 trade
1 muskets
1 with
1 a
1 supply
1 of
1 powder
1 and
1 ball
1 were
1 given
1 to
1 them
1 as
1 although
1 they
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 do
1 much
1 execution
1 with
1 these
1 weapons
1 their
1 possession
1 would
1 exercise
1 a
1 powerful
1 influence
1 over
1 any
1 natives
1 they
1 might
1 meet
1 In
1 crossing
1 the
1 country
1 to
1 the
1 Niger
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 were
1 the
1 objects
1 of
1 lively
1 curiosity
1 and
1 the
1 exhibition
1 of
1 the
1 magic
1 lantern
1 the
1 chemical
1 experiments
1 and
1 conjuring
1 tricks
1 created
1 an
1 effect
1 equal
1 to
1 that
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 produced
1 among
1 the
1 Fans
1 On
1 reaching
1 the
1 Niger
1 a
1 canoe
1 was
1 hired
1 with
1 a
1 crew
1 of
1 rowers
1 In
1 this
1 all
1 the
1 cases
1 filled
1 with
1 the
1 objects
1 they
1 had
1 collected
1 were
1 placed
1 the
1 whole
1 being
1 put
1 in
1 charge
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 Moses
1 and
1 King
1 John
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 seized
1 with
1 a
1 fit
1 of
1 homesickness
1 These
1 were
1 to
1 deliver
1 the
1 cases
1 to
1 the
1 charge
1 of
1 an
1 English
1 agent
1 at
1 Lagos
1 or
1 Bonny
1 to
1 both
1 of
1 whom
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 wrote
1 requesting
1 him
1 to
1 pay
1 the
1 sum
1 agreed
1 to
1 the
1 boatmen
1 on
1 the
1 safe
1 arrival
1 of
1 the
1 cases
1 and
1 also
1 to
1 pay
1 the
1 Houssas
1 who
1 preferred
1 taking
1 their
1 wages
1 there
1 as
1 it
1 was
1 not
1 considered
1 advisable
1 to
1 tempt
1 the
1 cupidity
1 of
1 any
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 princes
1 along
1 the
1 river
1 Should
1 they
1 be
1 overhauled
1 the
1 Houssas
1 were
1 told
1 to
1 open
1 the
1 cases
1 and
1 show
1 that
1 these
1 contained
1 nothing
1 but
1 birds
1 skins
1 and
1 insects
1 which
1 would
1 be
1 absolutely
1 valueless
1 in
1 the
1 eyes
1 of
1 a
1 native

1 the
1 precious
1 freight
1 had
1 fairly
1 started
1 the
1 party
1 crossed
1 the
1 Niger
1 in
1 a
1 canoe
1 arrangements
1 having
1 already
1 been
1 made
1 with
1 the
1 potentate
1 of
1 a
1 village
1 on
1 the
1 opposite
1 side
1 for
1 a
1 fresh
1 relay
1 of
1 carriers
1 twenty
1 men
1 being
1 now
1 sufficient
1 owing
1 to
1 the
1 gaps
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 in
1 the
1 provisions
1 in
1 the
1 goods
1 by
1 the
1 payment
1 of
1 the
1 carriers
1 and
1 presents
1 and
1 in

1 by
1 the
1 despatch
1 of
1 eight
1 of
1 the
1 largest
1 of
1 these
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 They
1 had
1 still
1 however
1 ample
1 space
1 for
1 the
1 collections
1 they
1 might
1 still
1 make
1 The
1 cases
1 of
1 goods
1 and
1 provisions
1 were
1 utilized
1 for
1 this
1 purpose
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 emptied
1 For
1 another
1 two
1 months
1 they
1 journeyed
1 on
1 halting
1 frequently
1 and
1 adding
1 continually
1 to
1 their
1 stores
1 The
1 country
1 was
1 fairly
1 populated
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 difficulty
1 in
1 buying
1 plantains
1 and
1 fruit
1 and
1 in
1 obtaining
1 fresh
1 sets
1 of
1 carriers
1 through
1 the
1 territories
1 of
1 each
1 petty
1 chief
1 They
1 were
1 now
1 approaching
1 the
1 Volta
1 when
1 one
1 day
1 a
1 native
1 covered
1 with
1 dust
1 and
1 bathed
1 in
1 perspiration
1 came
1 up
1 to
1 their
1 camp
1 and
1 throwing
1 himself
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 before
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 poured
1 out

1 He
1 been
1 down
1 near

1 country
1 Ugly
1 Tom
1 was
1 called
1 and
1 after
1 a
1 conversation
1 with
1 the
1 native
1 told
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 a
1 messenger
1 from
1 Abeokuta
1 that
1 the
1 people
1 there
1 were
1 threatened
1 by
1 an
1 attack
1 by
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 implored
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 who
1 they
1 heard
1 were
1 in
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 to
1 come
1 to
1 their
1 aid
1 hat
1 do
1 you
1 say
1 Frank
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 asked
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 anything
1 about
1 it
1 sir
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 heard
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 of
1 course
1 and
1 its
1 horrible
1 customs
1 but
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 know
1 anything
1 about
1 Abeokuta
1 Abeokuta
1 is
1 a
1 very
1 singular
1 town
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 Its
1 people
1 were
1 christianized
1 many
1 years
1 ago
1 and
1 have
1 faithfully
1 retained
1 the
1 religion
1 The
1 town
1 lies
1 not
1 very
1 far
1 from
1 Dahomey
1 and
1 this
1 power
1 which
1 has
1 conquered
1 and
1 enslaved
1 all
1 its
1 other
1 neighbors
1 has
1 been
1 unable
1 to
1 conquer
1 Abeokuta
1 although
1 it
1 has
1 several
1 times
1 besieged
1 it
1 The
1 Dahomey
1 people
1 have
1 every
1 advantage
1 being
1 supplied
1 with
1 firearms
1 and
1 even
1 cannon
1 by
1 the
1 rascally
1 white
1 traders
1 at
1 hydah
1 the
1 port
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 Nevertheless
1 the
1 Abeokuta
1 people
1 have
1 opposed
1 an
1 heroic
1 resistance
1 and
1 so
1 far
1 successfully
1 Of
1 course
1 they
1 know
1 that
1 every
1 soul
1 would
1 be
1 put
1 to
1 death
1 did
1 they
1 fall
1 into
1 the
1 hands
1 of
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 but
1 negroes
1 do
1 not
1 always
1 fight
1 well
1 even
1 under
1 such
1 circumstances
1 and
1 every
1 credit
1 must
1 be
1 given
1 to
1 the
1 people
1 of
1 Abeokuta
1 hat
1 do
1 you
1 say
1 It
1 will
1 be
1 a
1 perilous
1 business
1 mind
1 for
1 if
1 Abeokuta
1 is
1 taken
1 we
1 shall
1 assuredly
1 be
1 put
1 to
1 death
1 with
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 the
1 defenders
1 I
1 think
1 we
1 ought
1 to
1 help
1 them
1 sir
1 Frank
1 said
1 They
1 must
1 be
1 a
1 noble
1 people
1 and
1 with
1 our
1 guns
1 and
1 the
1 four
1 Houssas
1 we
1 might
1 really
1 be
1 of
1 material
1 assistance
1 Of
1 course
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 risk
1 in
1 it
1 but
1 we
1 have
1 risked
1 our
1 lives
1 from
1 fever
1 and
1 in
1 other
1 ways
1 every
1 day
1 since
1 we
1 ve

1 the
1 country
1 Very
1 well
1 my
1 lad
1 I
1 am
1 glad
1 that
1 is
1 your
1 decision
1 Tell
1 him
1 Ugly
1 Tom
1 that
1 we
1 will
1 at
1 once
1 move
1 towards
1 Abeokuta
1 with
1 all
1 speed
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 better
1 send
1 out
1 a
1 party
1 of
1 carriers
1 to
1 meet
1 us
1 as
1 you
1 may
1 be
1 sure
1 that
1 these
1 men
1 will
1 not
1 go
1 far
1 when
1 they
1 hear
1 that
1 the
1 Dahomey
1 people
1 are
1 on
1 the
1 warpath
1 Learn
1 from
1 him
1 exactly
1 the
1 road
1 we
1 must
1 move
1 by
1 as
1 if
1 our
1 carriers
1 desert
1 us
1 we
1 shall
1 be
1 detained
1 till
1 his
1 people
1 come
1 up
1 How
1 far
1 is
1 it
1 to
1 Abeokuta
1 Ugly
1 Tom
1 learned
1 from
1 the
1 native
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 about
1 forty
1 -five
1 miles
1 Very
1 well
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 we
1 shall
1 march
1 twenty
1 this
1 afternoon
1 here
1 we
1 halt
1 they
1 will
1 most
1 likely
1 have
1 heard
1 the
1 rumors
1 of
1 the
1 war
1 and
1 I
1 expect
1 the
1 carriers
1 will
1 go
1 no
1 farther
1 so
1 they
1 must
1 send
1 out
1 to
1 that
1 point
1 The
1 Houssa
1 translated
1 the
1 message
1 and
1 the
1 native
1 saying
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 at
1 Abeokuta
1 tonight
1 kissed
1 the
1 hands
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 and
1 started
1 at
1 a
1 trot
1 onderful
1 stamina
1 some
1 of
1 these
1 men
1 have
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 That
1 man
1 has
1 come
1 forty
1 -five
1 miles
1 at
1 full
1 speed
1 and
1 is
1 now
1 going
1 off
1 again
1 as
1 fresh
1 as
1 when
1 he
1 started
1 hat
1 speed
1 will
1 he
1 go
1 at
1 Frank
1 asked
1 About
1 six
1 miles
1 an
1 hour
1 Of
1 course
1 he
1 goes
1 faster
1 when
1 he
1 is
1 running
1 but
1 he
1 will
1 sometimes
1 break
1 into
1 a
1 walk
1 Five
1 miles
1 an
1 hour
1 may
1 be
1 taken
1 as
1 the
1 ordinary
1 pace
1 of
1 a
1 native
1 runner
1 but
1 in
1 cases
1 which
1 they
1 consider
1 of
1 importance
1 like
1 the
1 present
1 you
1 may
1 calculate
1 on
1 six
1 The
1 camp
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 broken
1 up
1 the
1 carriers
1 loaded
1 and
1 they
1 started
1 on
1 their
1 way
1 It
1 was
1 late
1 in
1 the
1 evening
1 when
1 they
1 reached
1 a
1 village
1 about
1 twenty
1 miles
1 from
1 their
1 starting
1 place
1 They
1 found
1 the
1 inhabitants
1 in
1 a
1 great
1 state
1 of
1 alarm
1 The
1 news
1 had
1 come
1 that
1 a
1 great
1 army
1 was
1 marching
1 to
1 attack
1 Abeokuta
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 had
1 sworn
1 on
1 his
1 father
1 s
1 skull
1 that
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 place
1 should
1 be
1 captured
1 and
1 not
1 a
1 house
1 or
1 a
1 wall
1 left
1 remaining
1 As
1 Abeokuta
1 was
1 certain
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 strong
1 resistance
1 and
1 to
1 hold
1 out
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 the
1 villagers
1 feared
1 that
1 the
1 Dahomey
1 people
1 would
1 be
1 sending
1 out
1 parties
1 to
1 plunder
1 and
1 carry
1 away
1 captives
1 all
1 over
1 the
1 surrounding
1 country
1 The
1 panic
1 at
1 once
1 extended
1 to
1 the
1 bearers
1 who
1 declared
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 not
1 go
1 a
1 foot
1 farther
1 As
1 their
1 fears
1 were
1 natural
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 was
1 expecting
1 a
1 fresh
1 relay
1 from
1 Abeokuta
1 on
1 the
1 following
1 evening
1 he
1 consented
1 to
1 their
1 demand
1 to
1 be
1 allowed
1 to
1 leave
1 immediately
1 and
1 paying
1 them
1 their
1 wages
1 due
1 he
1 allowed
1 them
1 to
1 depart
1 at
1 once
1 on
1 the
1 return
1 journey
1 The
1 tent
1 was
1 soon
1 pitched
1 and
1 supper
1 prepared
1 of
1 fried
1 plantains
1 rice
1 a
1 tin
1 of
1 sardines
1 and
1 tea
1 Later
1 on
1 they
1 had
1 a
1 cup
1 of
1 chocolate
1 and
1 turned
1 in
1 for
1 the
1 night
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 they
1 were
1 awakened
1 just
1 at
1 daybreak
1 by
1 great
1 talking
1 Men
1 come
1 for
1 baggage
1 sar
1 Ugly
1 Tom
1 said
1 putting
1 his
1 head
1 in
1 the
1 tent
1 door
1 They
1 have
1 lost
1 no
1 time
1 about
1 it
1 Frank
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 exclaimed
1 It
1 was
1 midday
1 yesterday
1 when
1 the
1 messenger
1 left
1 us
1 He
1 had
1 forty
1 -five
1 miles
1 to
1 run
1 and
1 could
1 not
1 have
1 been
1 in
1 till
1 pretty
1 nearly
1 eight
1 o
1 clock
1 and
1 these
1 men
1 must
1 have
1 started
1 at
1 once
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 time
1 lost
1 hile
1 the
1 Houssas
1 were
1 pulling
1 down
1 and
1 packing
1 up
1 the
1 tent
1 Ostik
1 prepared
1 two
1 bowls
1 of
1 chocolate
1 with
1 biscuit
1 soaked
1 in
1 it
1 By
1 the
1 time
1 that
1 this
1 was
1 eaten
1 the
1 carriers
1 had
1 taken
1 up
1 their
1 loads
1 and
1 two
1 minutes
1 later
1 the
1 whole
1 party
1 started
1 almost
1 at
1 a
1 trot
1 Ugly
1 Tom
1 soon
1 explained
1 the
1 cause
1 of
1 the
1 haste
1 The
1 army
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 was
1 the
1 evening
1 before
1 but
1 eight
1 miles
1 from
1 Abeokuta
1 and
1 was
1 expected
1 to
1 appear
1 before
1 the
1 town
1 by
1 midday
1 although
1 of
1 course
1 it
1 might
1 be
1 later
1 for
1 the
1 movements
1 of
1 savage
1 troops
1 are
1 uncertain
1 in
1 the
1 extreme
1 depending
1 entirely
1 upon
1 the
1 whims
1 of
1 their
1 leader
1 So
1 anxious
1 were
1 the
1 bearers
1 to
1 get
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 town
1 in
1 time
1 that
1 they
1 frequently
1 went
1 at
1 a
1 trot
1 They
1 were
1 the
1 better
1 able
1 to
1 keep
1 up
1 the
1 speed
1 as
1 a
1 larger
1 number
1 than
1 were
1 required
1 had
1 been
1 sent
1 Many
1 of
1 the
1 cases
1 too
1 were
1 light
1 consequently
1 the
1 men
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 shift
1 the
1 heavy
1 burdens
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 So
1 great
1 was
1 the
1 speed
1 that
1 after
1 an
1 hour
1 both
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 weakened
1 by
1 the
1 effect
1 of
1 fever
1 and
1 climate
1 could
1 no
1 longer
1 keep
1 up
1 The
1 various
1 effects
1 carried
1 in
1 the
1 hammocks
1 were
1 hastily
1 taken
1 out
1 and
1 lifted
1 by
1 men
1 unprovided
1 with
1 loads
1 The
1 white
1 men
1 entered
1 and
1 were
1 soon
1 carried
1 along
1 at
1 a
1 brisk
1 trot
1 by
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 baggage
1 hen
1 they
1 recovered
1 from
1 their
1 exhaustion
1 sufficiently
1 to
1 observe
1 what
1 was
1 going
1 on
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 help
1 admiring
1 the
1 manner
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 negroes
1 with
1 perspiration
1 streaming
1 from
1 every
1 pore
1 hurried
1 along
1 with
1 their
1 burdens
1 So
1 fast
1 did
1 they
1 go
1 that
1 in
1 less
1 than
1 six
1 hours
1 they
1 emerged
1 from
1 the
1 forest
1 into
1 the
1 clearing
1 and
1 a
1 shout
1 proclaimed
1 that
1 Abeokuta
1 was
1 close
1 at
1 hand
1 Ten
1 minutes
1 later
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 were
1 carried
1 through
1 the
1 gate
1 their
1 arrival
1 being
1 hailed
1 with
1 shouts
1 of
1 joy
1 by
1 the
1 inhabitants
1 They
1 were
1 carried
1 in
1 triumph
1 to
1 the
1 principal
1 building
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 a
1 large
1 hut
1 where
1 the
1 general
1 councils
1 of
1 the
1 people
1 were
1 held
1 Here
1 they
1 were
1 received
1 by
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 the
1 leading
1 inhabitants
1 who
1 thanked
1 them
1 warmly
1 for
1 coming
1 to
1 their
1 assistance
1 in
1 the
1 time
1 of
1 their
1 peril
1 The
1 travelers
1 were
1 both
1 struck
1 with
1 the
1 appearance
1 of
1 the
1 people
1 They
1 were
1 clad
1 with
1 far
1 more
1 decency
1 and
1 decorum
1 than
1 was
1 usual
1 among
1 the
1 negro
1 tribes
1 Their
1 bearing
1 was
1 quiet
1 and
1 dignified
1 An
1 air
1 of
1 neatness
1 and
1 order
1 pervaded
1 everything
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 clear
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 greatly
1 superior
1 to
1 the
1 people
1 around
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 expressed
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 the
1 willingness
1 with
1 which
1 his
1 friend
1 and
1 himself
1 took
1 part
1 in
1 the
1 struggle
1 of
1 a
1 brave
1 people
1 against
1 a
1 cruel
1 and
1 bloodthirsty
1 foe
1 and
1 he
1 said
1 that
1 as
1 the
1 four
1 Houssas
1 were
1 also
1 armed
1 with
1 fast
1 firing
1 guns
1 he
1 hoped
1 that
1 their
1 assistance
1 would
1 be
1 of
1 avail
1 He
1 said
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 at
1 once
1 examine
1 the
1 defences
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 see
1 if
1 anything
1 could
1 be
1 done
1 to
1 strengthen
1 them
1 Accompanied
1 by
1 the
1 king
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 made
1 a
1 detour
1 of
1 the
1 walls
1 These
1 were
1 about
1 a
1 mile
1 in
1 circumference
1 were
1 built
1 of
1 clay
1 and
1 were
1 of
1 considerable
1 height
1 and
1 thickness
1 but
1 they
1 were
1 not
1 calculated
1 to
1 resist
1 an
1 attack
1 by
1 artillery
1 As
1 however
1 it
1 was
1 not
1 probable
1 that
1 the
1 Dahomey
1 people
1 possessed
1 much
1 skill
1 in
1 the
1 management
1 of
1 their
1 cannon
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 hopes
1 that
1 they
1 should
1 succeed
1 in
1 repelling
1 the
1 assault
1 They
1 learnt
1 that
1 a
1 large
1 store
1 of
1 provisions
1 had
1 been
1 brought
1 into
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 that
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 women
1 and
1 children
1 had
1 been
1 sent
1 far
1 away
1 The
1 spies
1 presently
1 came
1 in
1 and
1 reported
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 movement
1 on
1 the
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 and
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 improbable
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 advance
1 before
1 the
1 next
1 day
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 was
1 unable
1 to
1 offer
1 any
1 suggestions
1 for
1 fresh
1 defenses
1 until
1 they
1 knew
1 upon
1 which
1 side
1 the
1 enemy
1 would
1 attack
1 He
1 advised
1 however
1 that
1 the
1 whole
1 population
1 should
1 be
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 throwing
1 up
1 an
1 earthwork
1 just
1 outside
1 each
1 gate
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 shelter
1 these
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 possible
1 from
1 the
1 effect
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 cannonballs
1 Orders
1 were
1 at
1 once
1 given
1 to
1 this
1 effect
1 and
1 in
1 an
1 hour
1 the
1 whole
1 population
1 were
1 at
1 work
1 carrying
1 earth
1 in
1 baskets
1 and
1 piling
1 it
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 the
1 gates
1 In
1 order
1 to
1 economize
1 labor
1 and
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 sides
1 of
1 the
1 mounds
1 as
1 steep
1 as
1 possible
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 directed
1 with
1 brushwood
1 forming
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 rough
1 wattle
1 work
1 Not
1 even
1 when
1 night
1 set
1 in
1 did
1 the
1 people
1 desist
1 from
1 their
1 labor
1 and
1 by
1 the
1 following
1 morning
1 the
1 gates
1 were
1 protected
1 from
1 the
1 effect
1 of
1 cannon
1 shot
1 by
1 mounds
1 of
1 earth
1 twenty
1 feet
1 high
1 which
1 rose
1 before
1 them
1 The
1 king
1 had
1 when
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 first
1 suggested
1 these
1 defenses
1 pointed
1 out
1 that
1 much
1 less
1 earth
1 would
1 be
1 required
1 were
1 it
1 piled
1 directly
1 against
1 the
1 gates
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 replied
1 that
1 certainly
1 this
1 was
1 so
1 but
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 essential
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 open
1 the
1 gates
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 sortie
1 if
1 necessary
1 against
1 the
1 enemy
1 and
1 although
1 the
1 king
1 shook
1 his
1 head
1 as
1 if
1 doubting
1 the
1 ability
1 of
1 his
1 people
1 to
1 take
1 such
1 a
1 desperate
1 step
1 as
1 that
1 of
1 attacking
1 the
1 enemy
1 outside
1 their
1 walls
1 he
1 yielded
1 to
1 Mr
1 Goodenough

1 A
1 spacious
1 and

1 was

1 at

1 Frank
1 asked

1 Goodenough
1 to

1 what
1 he
1 knew

1 It
1 was
1 attacked
1 by
1 Tacudona
1 the
1 chief
1 of
1 the
1 Fois
1 It
1 resisted
1 bravely
1 and
1 Tacudona
1 made
1 a
1 vow
1 that
1 if
1 he
1 took
1 it
1 he
1 would
1 sacrifice
1 the
1 king
1 to
1 the
1 gods
1 hen
1 he
1 captured

1 he
1 carried

1 ripping
1 open
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 then
1 called

1 Gradually
1 the

1 But
1 are

1 then
1 Frank
1 asked

1 Assuredly
1 we
1 are
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 The
1 Amazons
1 as
1 white
1 men
1 have
1 christened
1 the
1 force
1 are
1 the
1 flower
1 of
1 the
1 Dahomey
1 army
1 and
1 fight
1 with
1 extraordinary
1 bravery
1 and
1 ferocity
1 But
1 it
1 will
1 seem
1 dreadful
1 to
1 fire
1 at
1 women
1 Frank
1 said
1 That
1 is
1 merely
1 an
1 idea
1 of
1 civilization
1 Frank
1 In
1 countries
1 where
1 women
1 are
1 dependent
1 upon
1 men
1 leaving
1 to
1 them
1 the
1 work
1 of
1 providing
1 for
1 the
1 family
1 and
1 home
1 while
1 they
1 employ
1 themselves
1 in
1 domestic
1 duties
1 and
1 in
1 brightening
1 the
1 lives
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 they
1 are
1 treated
1 with
1 respect
1 But
1 as
1 their
1 work
1 becomes
1 rougher
1 so
1 does
1 the
1 position
1 which
1 they
1 occupy
1 in
1 men
1 s
1 esteem
1 fall
1 Among
1 the
1 middle
1 and
1 upper
1 classes
1 throughout
1 Europe
1 a
1 man
1 is
1 considered
1 a
1 brute
1 and
1 a
1 coward
1 who
1 lifts
1 his
1 hand
1 against
1 a
1 woman
1 Among
1 the
1 lower
1 classes
1 wife
1 and
1 woman
1 beating
1 is
1 by
1 no
1 means
1 uncommon
1 nor
1 is
1 such
1 an
1 assault
1 regarded
1 with
1 much
1 more
1 reprobation
1 than
1 an
1 attack
1 upon
1 a
1 man
1 hen
1 women
1 leave
1 their
1 proper
1 sphere
1 and
1 put
1 themselves
1 forward
1 to
1 do
1 man
1 s
1 work
1 they
1 must
1 expect
1 man
1 s
1 treatment
1 and
1 the
1 foolish
1 women
1 at
1 home
1 who
1 clamor
1 for
1 women
1 s
1 rights
1 that
1 is
1 to
1 say
1 for
1 an
1 equality
1 of
1 work
1 would
1 if
1 they
1 had
1 their
1 way
1 inflict
1 enormous
1 damage
1 upon
1 their
1 sex
1 Still
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 shan
1 t
1 like
1 having
1 to
1 fire
1 at
1 women
1 You
1 won
1 t
1 see
1 much
1 difference
1 between
1 women
1 and
1 men
1 when
1 the
1 fight
1 begins
1 Frank
1 These
1 female
1 furies
1 will
1 slay
1 all
1 who
1 fall
1 into
1 their
1 hands
1 and
1 therefore
1 in
1 self
1 defense
1 you
1 will
1 have
1 to
1 assist
1 in
1 slaying
1 them
1 The
1 following
1 day
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 beating
1 of
1 drums
1 and
1 firing
1 of
1 guns
1 was
1 heard
1 and
1 soon
1 afterwards
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 army
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 was
1 seen
1 approaching
1 It
1 moved
1 with
1 considerable
1 order
1 and
1 regularity
1 Those
1 must
1 be
1 the
1 Amazons
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 They
1 are
1 proud
1 of
1 their
1 drill
1 and
1 discipline
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 think
1 that
1 any
1 other
1 African
1 troops
1 could
1 march
1 so
1 regularly
1 and
1 solidly
1 The
1 main
1 body
1 of
1 the
1 army
1 now
1 came
1 in
1 view
1 marching
1 as
1 a
1 loose
1 and
1 scattered
1 mob
1 Then
1 twelve
1 objects
1 were
1 seen
1 dragged
1 by
1 oxen
1 These
1 were
1 the
1 cannon
1 of
1 the
1 besiegers
1 How
1 many
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 there
1 are
1 Frank
1 asked
1 It
1 is
1 very
1 difficult
1 to
1 judge
1 accurately
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 But
1 Dahomey
1 is
1 said
1 to
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 put
1 fifty
1 thousand
1 fighting
1 men
1 and
1 women
1 in
1 the
1 field
1 that
1 is
1 to
1 say
1 her
1 whole
1 adult
1 population
1 except
1 those
1 too
1 old
1 to
1 bear
1 arms
1 I
1 should
1 think
1 that
1 there
1 are
1 twenty
1 or
1 twenty
1 -five
1 thousand
1 now
1 in
1 sight
1 The
1 enemy
1 approached
1 within
1 musket
1 shot
1 of
1 the
1 walls
1 and
1 numbers
1 of
1 them
1 running
1 up
1 discharged
1 their
1 muskets
1 The
1 Abeokuta
1 people
1 fired
1 back
1 but
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 ordered
1 the
1 Houssas
1 on
1 no
1 account
1 to
1 fire
1 as
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 wish
1 the
1 enemy
1 to
1 know
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 their
1 rifles
1 The
1 first
1 step
1 of
1 the
1 besiegers
1 was
1 to
1 cut
1 down
1 all
1 the
1 plantations
1 round
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 to
1 erect
1 great
1 numbers
1 of
1 little
1 huts
1 A
1 large
1 central
1 hut
1 with
1 several
1 smaller
1 ones
1 surrounding
1 it
1 was
1 erected
1 for
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 his
1 principal
1 nobles
1 The
1 Dahomans
1 spread
1 round
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 by
1 the
1 gesticulation
1 and
1 pointing
1 at
1 the
1 gates
1 it
1 was
1 clear
1 that
1 the
1 defenses
1 raised
1 to
1 cover
1 these
1 excited
1 great
1 surprise
1 The
1 wall
1 was
1 thick
1 enough
1 for
1 men
1 to
1 walk
1 along
1 on
1 the
1 top
1 but
1 being
1 built
1 of
1 clay
1 it
1 would
1 withstand
1 but
1 little
1 battering
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 set
1 a
1 large
1 number
1 of
1 people
1 to
1 work
1 making
1 sacks
1 from
1 the
1 rough
1 cloth
1 of
1 which
1 there
1 was
1 an
1 abundance
1 in
1 the
1 place
1 These
1 were
1 filled
1 with
1 earth
1 and
1 piled
1 in
1 the
1 center
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 ready
1 for
1 conveyance
1 to
1 any
1 point
1 threatened
1 He
1 likewise
1 had
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 beams
1 used
1 in
1 construction
1 of
1 houses
1 sharpened
1 at
1 one
1 end
1 stakes
1 of
1 five
1 or
1 six
1 feet
1 long
1 were
1 also
1 prepared
1 and
1 sharpened
1 at
1 both
1 ends
1 That
1 day
1 the
1 enemy
1 attempted
1 nothing
1 against
1 the
1 town
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 the
1 twelve
1 cannon
1 were
1 planted
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 of
1 about
1 five
1 hundred
1 yards
1 and
1 opened
1 fire
1 on
1 the
1 walls
1 The
1 shooting
1 was
1 wild
1 in
1 the
1 extreme
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 balls
1 went
1 over
1 the
1 place
1 altogether
1 others
1 topped
1 the
1 wall
1 and
1 fell
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 some
1 hit
1 the
1 wall
1 and
1 buried
1 themselves
1 in
1 the
1 clay
1 e
1 will
1 give
1 them
1 a
1 lesson
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 in
1 the
1 modern
1 rifle
1 Frank
1 you
1 take
1 my
1 double
1 barrel
1 rifle
1 and
1 I
1 will
1 take
1 the
1 heavy
1 large
1 bored
1 one
1 Your
1 inchester
1 will
1 scarcely
1 make
1 accurate
1 firing
1 at
1 five
1 hundred
1 yards
1 The
1 Houssas
1 were
1 already
1 on
1 the
1 wall
1 anxious
1 to
1 open
1 fire
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 saw
1 that
1 their
1 rifles
1 were
1 sighted
1 to
1 five
1 hundred
1 yards
1 The
1 cannon
1 offered
1 an
1 easy
1 mark
1 They
1 were
1 ranged
1 along
1 side
1 by
1 side
1 surrounded
1 by
1 a
1 crowd
1 of
1 negroes
1 who
1 yelled
1 and
1 danced
1 each
1 time
1 a
1 shot
1 struck
1 the
1 wall
1 Now
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 to
1 the
1 Houssas
1 fire
1 steadily
1 and
1 above
1 all
1 fire
1 straight
1 I
1 want
1 every
1 shot
1 to
1 tell
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 gave
1 the
1 signal
1 and
1 at
1 once
1 Frank
1 and
1 the
1 Houssas
1 opened
1 fire
1 The
1 triumphant
1 yells
1 of
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 at
1 once
1 changed
1 their
1 character
1 and
1 a
1 cry
1 of
1 wrath
1 and
1 astonishment
1 broke
1 from
1 them
1 Steadily
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 his
1 party
1 kept
1 up
1 their
1 fire
1 They
1 could
1 see
1 that
1 great
1 execution
1 was
1 being
1 done
1 a
1 large
1 proportion
1 of
1 the
1 shots
1 telling
1 Many
1 wounded
1 were
1 carried
1 to
1 the
1 rear
1 and
1 black
1 forms
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 stretched
1 everywhere
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 Still
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 fire
1 continued
1 with
1 unabated
1 vigor
1 They
1 fight
1 very
1 pluckily
1 Frank
1 said
1 They
1 are
1 plucky
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 answered
1 and
1 as
1 cowardice
1 is
1 punished
1 with
1 death
1 and
1 human
1 life
1 has
1 scarcely
1 any
1 value
1 among
1 them
1 they
1 will
1 be
1 killed
1 where
1 they
1 stand
1 rather
1 than
1 retreat
1 For
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 hours
1 the
1 fight
1 continued
1 Several
1 officers
1 evidently
1 of
1 authority
1 surrounded
1 by
1 groups
1 of
1 attendants
1 came
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 guns
1 but
1 as
1 Frank
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 always
1 selected
1 these
1 for
1 their
1 mark
1 and
1 -
1 -firing
1 with
1 their
1 guns
1 resting
1 on
1 the
1 parapet
1 -
1 -were
1 able
1 to
1 make
1 very
1 accurate
1 shooting
1 most
1 of
1 them
1 were
1 killed
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 of
1 their
1 arriving
1 on
1 the
1 spot
1 At
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 four
1 hours
1 the
1 firing
1 ceased
1 and
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 retired
1 from
1 their
1 guns
1 The
1 Abeokuta
1 people
1 raised
1 a
1 cry
1 of
1 triumph
1 I
1 imagine
1 they
1 have
1 only
1 fallen
1 back
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 to
1 give
1 the
1 guns
1 time
1 to
1 cool
1 hile
1 the
1 cannonade
1 had
1 been
1 going
1 on
1 a
1 brisk
1 attack
1 had
1 been
1 kept
1 up
1 on
1 several
1 other
1 points
1 of
1 the
1 wall
1 the
1 enemy
1 advancing
1 within
1 fifty
1 yards
1 of
1 this
1 and
1 firing
1 their
1 muskets
1 loaded
1 with
1 heavy
1 charges
1 of
1 slugs
1 at
1 the
1 defenders
1 who
1 replied
1 vigorously
1 to
1 them
1 Their
1 cannonade
1 was
1 not
1 resumed
1 that
1 afternoon
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 contenting
1 themselves
1 with
1 skirmishing
1 round
1 the
1 walls
1 They
1 are
1 disappointed
1 with
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 their
1 fire
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 No
1 doubt
1 they
1 anticipated
1 they
1 should
1 knock
1 the
1 wall
1 down
1 without
1 difficulty
1 You
1 will
1 see
1 some
1 change
1 in
1 their
1 tactics
1 tomorrow
1 That
1 night
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 barrels
1 of
1 palm
1 oil
1 carried
1 on
1 to
1 the
1 wall
1 with
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 great
1 iron
1 pots
1 used
1 for
1 boiling
1 down
1 the
1 oil
1 and
1 a
1 supply
1 of
1 fuel
1 If
1 they
1 try
1 to
1 storm
1 he
1 said
1 it
1 will
1 most
1 likely
1 be
1 at
1 the
1 point
1 which
1 they
1 have
1 been
1 firing
1 at
1 The
1 parapet
1 is
1 knocked
1 down
1 in
1 several
1 places
1 and
1 the
1 defenders
1 there
1 would
1 be
1 more
1 exposed
1 to
1 their
1 fire
1 It
1 was
1 at
1 this
1 point
1 therefore
1 that
1 the
1 provision
1 of
1 oil
1 was
1 placed
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 ordered
1 fires
1 to
1 be
1 lighted
1 under
1 the
1 boilers
1 an
1 hour
1 before
1 daybreak
1 in
1 order
1 that
1 all
1 should
1 be
1 in
1 readiness
1 in
1 case
1 an
1 attack
1 should
1 be
1 made
1 the
1 first
1 thing
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 The
1 Abeokutans
1 were
1 in
1 high
1 spirits
1 at
1 the
1 effect
1 of
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 their
1 white
1 allies
1 and
1 at
1 the
1 comparative
1 failure
1 of
1 the
1 cannon
1 at
1 whose
1 power
1 they
1 had
1 before
1 been
1 greatly
1 alarmed
1 Soon
1 after
1 daylight
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 were
1 seen
1 gathering
1 near
1 the
1 guns
1 Their
1 drums
1 beat
1 furiously
1 and
1 presently
1 they
1 advanced
1 in
1 a
1 solid
1 mass
1 against
1 the
1 wall
1 They
1 have
1 got
1 ladders
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 I
1 can
1 see
1 numbers
1 of
1 them
1 carrying
1 something
1 The
1 Houssas
1 at
1 once
1 opened
1 fire
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 enemy
1 approached
1 closer
1 first
1 the
1 Abeokutans
1 who
1 had
1 muskets
1 then
1 the
1 great
1 mass
1 with
1 bows
1 and
1 arrows
1 began
1 to
1 fire
1 upon
1 the
1 enemy
1 while
1 these
1 answered
1 with
1 their
1 musketry
1 The
1 central
1 body
1 however
1 advanced
1 without
1 firing
1 a
1 shot
1 moving
1 like
1 the
1 rest
1 at
1 a
1 quick
1 run
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 were
1 not
1 firing
1 now
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 devoting
1 themselves
1 to
1 superintending
1 the
1 defence
1 Ostik
1 kept
1 close
1 to
1 them
1 carrying
1 Frank
1 s
1 inchester
1 carbine
1 and
1 a
1 double
1 barreled
1 shotgun
1 This
1 is
1 hot
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 as
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 slugs
1 and
1 bullets
1 whizzed
1 in
1 a
1 storm
1 over
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 parapet
1 killing
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 defenders
1 and
1 rendering
1 it
1 difficult
1 for
1 the
1 others
1 to
1 take
1 accurate
1 aim
1 This
1 however
1 the
1 Abeokutans
1 did
1 not
1 try
1 to
1 do
1 Stooping
1 below
1 the
1 parapet
1 they
1 fitted
1 their
1 arrows
1 to
1 the
1 string
1 or
1 loaded
1 their
1 muskets
1 and
1 then
1 standing
1 up
1 fired
1 hastily
1 at
1 the
1 approaching
1 throng
1 The
1 walls
1 were
1 about
1 twenty
1 -five
1 feet
1 high
1 inside
1 but
1 the
1 parapet
1 gave
1 an
1 additional
1 height
1 of
1 some
1 four
1 feet
1 outside
1 They
1 were
1 about
1 three
1 feet
1 thick
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 and
1 but
1 a
1 limited
1 number
1 of
1 men
1 could
1 take
1 post
1 there
1 to
1 oppose
1 the
1 storming
1 party
1 Strong
1 bodies
1 were
1 placed
1 farther
1 along
1 on
1 the
1 wall
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 rush
1 to
1 sweep
1 the
1 enemy
1 off
1 should
1 they
1 gain
1 a
1 footing
1 Others
1 were
1 posted
1 below
1 to
1 attack
1 them
1 should
1 they
1 leap
1 down
1 into
1 the
1 town
1 while
1 men
1 with
1 muskets
1 were
1 on
1 the
1 roofs
1 of
1 the
1 houses
1 near
1 the
1 walls
1 in
1 readiness
1 to
1 open
1 fire
1 should
1 the
1 enemy
1 get
1 a
1 footing
1 on
1 the
1 wall
1 The
1 din
1 was
1 prodigious
1 The
1 Dahomans
1 having
1 access
1 to
1 the
1 sea
1 coast
1 were
1 armed
1 entirely
1 with
1 muskets
1 these
1 being
1 either
1 cheap
1 Birmingham
1 trade
1 guns
1 or
1 old
1 converted
1 muskets
1 bought
1 by
1 traders
1 for
1 a
1 song
1 at
1 the
1 sale
1 of
1 disused
1 government
1 stores
1 It
1 is
1 much
1 to
1 be
1 regretted
1 that
1 the
1 various
1 governments
1 of
1 Europe
1 do
1 not
1 insist
1 that
1 their
1 old
1 guns
1 shall
1 be
1 used
1 only
1 as
1 old
1 iron
1 The
1 price
1 obtained
1 for
1 them
1 is
1 so
1 trifling
1 as
1 to
1 be
1 immaterial
1 and
1 the
1 great
1 proportion
1 of
1 them
1 find
1 their
1 way
1 to
1 Africa
1 to
1 be
1 used
1 in
1 the
1 constant
1 wars
1 that
1 are
1 waged
1 there
1 and
1 to
1 enable
1 rich
1 and
1 powerful
1 tribes
1 to
1 enslave
1 and
1 destroy
1 their
1 weaker
1 neighbors
1 The
1 Africans
1 use
1 very
1 much
1 heavier
1 charges
1 of
1 powder
1 than
1 those
1 in
1 used
1 in
1 civilized
1 nations
1 ramming
1 down
1 a
1 handful
1 of
1 slugs
1 of
1 half
1 a
1 dozen
1 small
1 bullets
1 upon
1 the
1 powder
1 This
1 does
1 not
1 conduce
1 to
1 good
1 shooting
1 but
1 the
1 noise
1 made
1 is
1 prodigious
1 The
1 Abeokutans
1 on
1 the
1 other
1 hand
1 were
1 principally
1 armed
1 with
1 bows
1 and
1 arrows
1 as
1 having
1 no
1 direct
1 access
1 to
1 the
1 sea
1 coast
1 it
1 was
1 difficult
1 for
1 them
1 to
1 procure
1 guns
1 The
1 Dahomans
1 poured
1 up
1 in
1 a
1 mass
1 to
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 wall
1 and
1 then
1 a
1 score
1 of
1 rough
1 ladders
1 constructed
1 of
1 bamboo
1 and
1 each
1 four
1 feet
1 wide
1 were
1 placed
1 against
1 the
1 walls
1 Directly
1 the
1 point
1 to
1 be
1 attacked
1 was
1 indicated
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 distributed
1 his
1 cauldrons
1 of
1 boiling
1 oil
1 along
1 the
1 walls
1 and
1 had
1 set
1 men
1 to
1 work
1 to
1 pierce
1 holes
1 through
1 the
1 parapet
1 at
1 distances
1 of
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 feet
1 apart
1 and
1 at
1 a
1 height
1 of
1 six
1 inches
1 from
1 the
1 ground
1 A
1 line
1 of
1 men
1 with
1 long
1 spears
1 wore
1 told
1 to
1 lie
1 down
1 upon
1 the
1 ground
1 and
1 to
1 thrust
1 through
1 the
1 holes
1 at
1 those
1 climbing
1 the
1 ladders
1 Another
1 line
1 of
1 holes
1 was
1 pierced
1 two
1 feet
1 higher
1 through
1 which
1 those
1 armed
1 with
1 muskets
1 and
1 bows
1 were
1 to
1 fire
1 for
1 when
1 the
1 enemy
1 reached
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 walls
1 their
1 fire
1 was
1 so
1 heavy
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 impossible
1 to
1 return
1 it
1 over
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 the
1 parapet
1 Immediately
1 the
1 ladders
1 were
1 placed
1 men
1 with
1 ladles
1 began
1 to
1 throw
1 the
1 boiling
1 oil
1 over
1 the
1 parapet
1 Shrieks
1 and
1 yells
1 from
1 below
1 at
1 once
1 testified
1 to
1 its
1 effect
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 only
1 just
1 where
1 the
1 cauldrons
1 were
1 placed
1 that
1 the
1 besiegers
1 were
1 prevented
1 by
1 this
1 means
1 from
1 mounting
1 the
1 ladders
1 and
1 even
1 here
1 many
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 agony
1 of
1 their
1 burns
1 climbed
1 desperately
1 upward
1 hen
1 they
1 neared
1 the
1 top
1 the
1 fight
1 began
1 in
1 earnest
1 Those
1 without
1 were
1 now
1 obliged
1 to
1 cease
1 firing
1 and
1 the
1 besieged
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 stand
1 up
1 and
1 with
1 sword
1 and
1 spear
1 defend
1 their
1 position
1 The
1 breech
1 loaders
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 the
1 Houssas
1 and
1 Frank
1 s
1 repeating
1 carbine
1 now
1 came
1 into
1 play
1 The
1 Dahomans
1 fought
1 with
1 extraordinary
1 bravery
1 hundreds
1 fell
1 shot
1 or
1 cut
1 down
1 from
1 above
1 or
1 pierced
1 by
1 the
1 spears
1 and
1 arrows
1 through
1 the
1 holes
1 in
1 the
1 parapet
1 Fresh
1 swarms
1 of
1 assailants
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 on
1 the
1 ladders
1 The
1 drums
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 ceaseless
1 rattle
1 and
1 the
1 yells
1 of
1 the
1 mass
1 of
1 negroes
1 standing
1 inactive
1 were
1 deafening
1 Their
1 efforts
1 however
1 were
1 in
1 vain
1 Never
1 did
1 the
1 Amazons
1 fight
1 with
1 more
1 reckless
1 bravery
1 but
1 the
1 position
1 was
1 too
1 strong
1 for
1 them
1 and
1 at
1 last
1 after
1 upwards
1 of
1 a
1 thousand
1 of
1 the
1 assailants
1 had
1 fallen
1 the
1 attack
1 was
1 given
1 up
1 and
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 retired
1 from
1 the
1 wall
1 followed
1 by
1 the
1 exulting
1 shouts
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 of
1 Abeokuta
1 The
1 loss
1 of
1 the
1 defenders
1 was
1 small
1 Some
1 ten
1 or
1 twelve
1 had
1 been
1 killed
1 with
1 slugs
1 Three
1 or
1 four
1 times
1 that
1 number
1 were
1 more
1 or
1 less
1 severely
1 wounded
1 about
1 the
1 head
1 or
1 shoulders
1 with
1 the
1 same
1 missiles
1 Frank
1 had
1 a
1 nasty
1 cut
1 on
1 the
1 cheek
1 and
1 Firewater
1 and
1 Bacon
1 were
1 both
1 streaming
1 with
1 blood
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 chance
1 of
1 a
1 renewal
1 of
1 the
1 attack
1 that
1 day
1 Sentries
1 were
1 placed
1 on
1 the
1 walls
1 and
1 a
1 grand
1 thanksgiving
1 service
1 was
1 held
1 in
1 the
1 open
1 space
1 in
1 the
1 center
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 which
1 the

1 attended
1 hat
1 will
1 be
1 their
1 next
1 move
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 Frank
1 asked
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 I
1 cannot
1 say
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 but
1 these
1 people
1 know
1 something
1 of
1 warfare
1 and
1 finding
1 that
1 they
1 cannot
1 carry
1 the
1 place
1 by
1 assault
1 I
1 think
1 you
1 will
1 find
1 that
1 they
1 will
1 try
1 some
1 more
1 cautious
1 move
1 next
1 time
1 For
1 two
1 days
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 renewal
1 of
1 the
1 attack
1 At
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 suggestion
1 the
1 Abeokutans
1 on
1 the
1 wall
1 shouted
1 out
1 that
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 might
1 come
1 and
1 carry
1 off
1 their
1 dead
1 as
1 he
1 feared
1 that
1 a
1 pestilence
1 might
1 arise
1 from
1 so
1 great
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 decomposing
1 bodies
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 wall
1 The
1 Dahomans
1 paid
1 no
1 attention
1 to
1 the
1 request
1 and
1 at
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 suggestion
1 on
1 the
1 second
1 day
1 the
1 whole
1 populace
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 carrying
1 earth
1 in
1 baskets
1 to
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 the
1 wall
1 and
1 throwing
1 this
1 over
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 cover
1 the
1 mass
1 of
1 bodies
1 at
1 its
1 foot
1 As
1 to
1 those
1 lying
1 farther
1 off
1 nothing
1 could
1 be
1 done
1 On
1 the
1 third
1 morning
1 it
1 was
1 seen
1 that
1 during
1 the
1 night
1 a
1 large
1 number
1 of
1 sacks
1 had
1 been
1 piled
1 in
1 a
1 line
1 upon
1 the
1 ground
1 two
1 hundred
1 yards
1 away
1 from
1 the
1 wall
1 The
1 pile
1 was
1 eight
1 feet
1 in
1 height
1 and
1 some
1 fifty
1 yards
1 long
1 I
1 thought
1 they
1 were
1 up
1 to
1 something
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 They
1 have
1 been
1 sending
1 back
1 to
1 Dahomey
1 for
1 sacks
1 In
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 the
1 enemy
1 brought
1 up
1 their
1 cannon
1 behind
1 the
1 shelter
1 of
1 the
1 sacks
1 regardless
1 of
1 the
1 execution
1 done
1 by
1 the
1 rifles
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 party
1 during
1 the
1 movement
1 The
1 place
1 chosen
1 was
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 hundred
1 yards
1 to
1 the
1 left
1 of
1 that
1 on
1 which
1 the
1 former
1 attack
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 Then
1 a
1 swarm
1 of
1 men
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 removing
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 sacks
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 twelve
1 rough
1 embrasures
1 were
1 made
1 just
1 wide
1 enough
1 for
1 the
1 muzzles
1 of
1 the
1 guns
1 the
1 sacks
1 removed
1 being
1 piled
1 on
1 the
1 others
1 raising
1 them
1 to
1 the
1 height
1 of
1 ten
1 feet
1 and
1 sheltering
1 the
1 men
1 behind
1 completely
1 from
1 the
1 fire
1 from
1 the
1 walls
1 They
1 will
1 make
1 a
1 breach
1 now
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 e
1 must
1 prepare
1 to
1 receive
1 them
1 inside
1 The
1 populace
1 were
1 at
1 once
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 digging
1 holes
1 and
1 securely
1 planting
1 the
1 beams
1 already
1 prepared
1 in
1 a
1 semicircle
1 a
1 hundred
1 feet
1 across
1 behind
1 the
1 wall
1 facing
1 the
1 battery
1 The
1 beams
1 when
1 fixed
1 projected
1 eight
1 feet
1 above
1 the
1 ground
1 the
1 spaces
1 between
1 being
1 filled
1 with
1 bamboos
1 twisted
1 in
1 and
1 out
1 between
1 them
1 Earth
1 was
1 thrown
1 up
1 behind
1 to
1 the
1 height
1 of
1 four
1 foot
1 for
1 the
1 defenders
1 to
1 stand
1 upon
1 The
1 space
1 between
1 the
1 stockade
1 and
1 the
1 wall
1 was
1 filled
1 with
1 sharp
1 pointed
1 bamboos
1 and
1 stakes
1 stuck
1 firmly
1 in
1 the
1 ground
1 with
1 their
1 points
1 projecting
1 outwards
1 All
1 day
1 the
1 townspeople
1 labored
1 at
1 these
1 defenses
1 while
1 the
1 wall
1 crumbled
1 fast
1 under
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 Dahomey
1 artillery
1 every
1 shot
1 of
1 which
1 at
1 so
1 short
1 a
1 distance
1 struck
1 it
1 heavily
1 By
1 five
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 a
1 great
1 gap
1 fifty
1 feet
1 wide
1 was
1 made
1 in
1 the
1 walls
1 and
1 the
1 army
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 again
1 gathered
1 for
1 the
1 assault
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 with
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 Houssas
1 took
1 his
1 place
1 on
1 the
1 wall
1 on
1 one
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 gap
1 Frank
1 with
1 the
1 other
1 two
1 faced
1 him
1 across
1 the
1 chasm
1 A
1 large
1 number
1 of
1 the
1 Abeokuta
1 warriors
1 also
1 lined
1 the
1 walls
1 while
1 the
1 rest
1 gathered
1 on
1 the
1 stockade
1 ith
1 the
1 usual
1 tumult
1 of
1 drumming
1 and
1 yells
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 rushed
1 to
1 the
1 assault
1 The
1 fire
1 from
1 the
1 walls
1 did
1 not
1 check
1 the
1 onset
1 in
1 the
1 slightest
1 and
1 with
1 yells
1 of
1 anticipated
1 victory
1 they
1 swarmed
1 over
1 the
1 breach
1 A
1 cry
1 of
1 astonishment
1 broke
1 from
1 them
1 as
1 they
1 saw
1 the
1 formidable
1 defense
1 within
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 whose
1 defenders
1 was
1 concentrated
1 upon
1 them
1 Then
1 with
1 scarce
1 a
1 pause
1 they
1 leaped
1 down
1 and
1 strove
1 to
1 remove
1 the
1 obstructions
1 Regardless
1 of
1 the
1 fire
1 poured
1 upon
1 them
1 they
1 hewed
1 away
1 at
1 the
1 sharp
1 stakes
1 or
1 strove
1 to
1 pull
1 them
1 up
1 with
1 their
1 hands
1 The
1 riflemen
1 on
1 the
1 walls
1 directed
1 their
1 fire
1 now
1 exclusively

1 of
1 the

1 the

1 doing
1 immense
1 execution
1 and
1 soon
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 in
1 their
1 efforts
1 to
1 advance
1 had
1 to
1 climb
1 over
1 lines
1 of
1 dead
1 in
1 their
1 front
1 For
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 the
1 struggle
1 continued
1 and
1 then
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 lost
1 heart
1 and
1 retired
1 leaving
1 fifteen
1 hundred
1 of
1 their
1 number
1 piled
1 deep
1 in
1 the
1 space
1 between
1 the
1 breach
1 and
1 the
1 stockade
1 This
1 is
1 horrible
1 work
1 Frank
1 said
1 when
1 he
1 rejoined
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Horrible
1 Frank
1 but
1 there
1 is
1 at
1 least
1 the
1 consolation
1 that
1 by
1 this
1 fearful
1 slaughter
1 of
1 their
1 bravest
1 warriors
1 we
1 are
1 crippling
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 as
1 a
1 curse
1 and
1 a
1 scourge
1 to
1 its
1 neighbors
1 After
1 this
1 crushing
1 repulse
1 the
1 Abeokutans
1 may
1 hope
1 that
1 many
1 years
1 will
1 elapse
1 before
1 they
1 are
1 again
1 attacked
1 by
1 their
1 savage
1 neighbors
1 and
1 the
1 lessons
1 which
1 they
1 have
1 now
1 learned
1 in
1 defense
1 will
1 enable
1 them
1 to
1 make
1 as
1 good
1 a
1 stand
1 on
1 another
1 occasion
1 as
1 they
1 have
1 done
1 now
1 Do
1 you
1 think
1 the
1 attack
1 will
1 be
1 renewed
1 I
1 should
1 hardly
1 think
1 so
1 The
1 flower
1 of
1 their
1 army
1 must
1 have
1 fallen
1 and
1 the
1 Amazon
1 guard
1 must
1 have
1 almost
1 ceased
1 to
1 exist
1 I
1 told
1 you
1 Frank
1 you
1 would
1 soon
1 get
1 over
1 your
1 repugnance
1 to
1 firing
1 at
1 women
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 think
1 anything
1 about
1 women
1 Frank
1 said
1 e
1 seemed
1 to
1 be
1 fighting
1 a
1 body
1 of
1 demons
1 with
1 their
1 wild
1 screams
1 and
1 yells
1 Indeed
1 I
1 could
1 scarce
1 distinguish
1 the
1 men
1 from
1 the
1 women
1 A
1 strong
1 guard
1 was
1 placed
1 at
1 night
1 at
1 the
1 stockade
1 and
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 lay
1 down
1 close
1 at
1 hand
1 in
1 case
1 the
1 assault
1 should
1 be
1 renewed
1 At
1 daybreak
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 a
1 cannon
1 caused
1 them
1 to
1 start
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 They
1 are
1 not
1 satisfied
1 yet
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 exclaimed
1 hurrying
1 to
1 the
1 wall
1 In
1 the
1 night
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 had
1 either
1 with
1 sacks
1 or
1 earth
1 raised
1 their
1 cannon
1 some
1 six
1 feet
1 so
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 fire
1 over
1 the
1 mound
1 caused
1 by
1 the
1 fallen
1 wall
1 at
1 the
1 stockade
1 behind
1 it
1 at
1 which
1 they
1 were
1 now
1 directing
1 their
1 fire
1 Now
1 for
1 the
1 sacks
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 Running
1 down
1 he
1 directed
1 the
1 sacks
1 laden
1 with
1 earth
1 to
1 whose
1 necks
1 ropes
1 had
1 been
1 attached
1 to
1 be
1 brought
1 up
1 Five
1 hundred
1 willing
1 hands
1 seized
1 them
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 lowered
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 the
1 center
1 of
1 the
1 stockade
1 which
1 was
1 alone
1 exposed
1 to
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 fire
1 until
1 they
1 hung
1 two
1 deep
1 over
1 the
1 whole
1 face
1 As
1 fast
1 as
1 one
1 bag
1 was
1 injured
1 by
1 a
1 shot
1 it
1 was
1 drawn
1 up
1 and

1 lowered
1 to
1 its
1 place
1 In
1 the
1 meantime
1 the
1 rifles
1 from
1 the
1 walls
1 had
1 again
1 opened
1 fire
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 gunners
1 were
1 now
1 more
1 exposed
1 their
1 shots
1 did
1 considerable
1 execution
1 Seeing
1 the
1 uselessness
1 of
1 their
1 efforts
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 gradually
1 slackened
1 their
1 fire

1 night
1 came
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 gathered
1 two
1 hundred
1 of
1 the
1 best
1 troops
1 of
1 Abeokuta
1 He
1 caused
1 plugs
1 to
1 be
1 made
1 corresponding
1 to
1 the
1 size
1 of
1 the
1 various
1 cannonballs
1 which
1 were
1 picked
1 up
1 within
1 the
1 stockade
1 which
1 varied
1 from
1 six
1 to
1 eighteen
1 pounders
1 About
1 midnight
1 the
1 gate
1 nearest
1 to
1 the
1 breach
1 was
1 thrown
1 open
1 and
1 the
1 party
1 sallied
1 out
1 and
1 made
1 their
1 way
1 towards
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 battery
1 The
1 Dahomans
1 had
1 placed
1 sentries
1 in
1 front
1 facing
1 the
1 breach
1 but
1 anticipating
1 no
1 attack
1 in
1 any
1 other
1 direction
1 had
1 left
1 the
1 flanks
1 unguarded
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 enjoined
1 the
1 strictest
1 silence
1 on
1 his
1 followers
1 and
1 their
1 approach
1 was
1 unobserved
1 until
1 they
1 swept
1 round
1 into
1 the
1 battery
1 Large
1 numbers
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 were
1 lying
1 asleep
1 here
1 but
1 these
1 taken
1 by
1 surprise
1 could
1 offer
1 no
1 resistance
1 and
1 were
1 cut
1 down
1 or
1 driven
1 away
1 instantly
1 by
1 the
1 assailants
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 with
1 a
1 party
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 told
1 off
1 specially
1 for
1 the
1 purpose
1 at
1 once
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 at
1 the
1 cannon
1 These
1 were
1 filled
1 nearly
1 to
1 the
1 muzzle
1 with
1 powder
1 and
1 the
1 plugs
1 were
1 driven
1 with
1 mallets
1 tight
1 into
1 the
1 muzzles
1 Slow
1 matches
1 composed

1 were
1 placed
1 in

1 Then
1 the
1 word
1 was

1 and
1 the

1 fell
1 back
1 to
1 the
1 gate
1 just
1 as
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 in

1 came
1 running
1 up
1 In

1 CHAPTER
1 XVI
1 CAPTIVES
1 IN
1 COOMASSIE
1 Upon
1 the
1 morning
1 following
1 the
1 successful
1 sortie
1 not
1 an
1 enemy
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 from
1 the
1 walls
1 Swift
1 runners
1 were
1 sent
1 out
1 and
1 these
1 returned
1 in
1 two
1 hours
1 with
1 news
1 that
1 the
1 enemy
1 were
1 in
1 full
1 retreat
1 towards
1 their
1 capital
1 The
1 people
1 of
1 Abeokuta
1 were
1 half
1 wild
1 with
1 exultation
1 and
1 joy
1 and
1 their
1 gratitude
1 to
1 their
1 white
1 allies
1 was
1 unbounded
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 begged
1 them
1 not
1 to
1 lose
1 an
1 hour
1 in
1 burying
1 their
1 slain
1 enemies
1 and
1 the
1 entire
1 population
1 were
1 engaged
1 for
1 the
1 two
1 following
1 days
1 upon
1 this
1 necessary
1 but
1 revolting
1 duty
1 The
1 dead
1 were
1 counted
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 placed
1 in
1 the
1 great
1 pits
1 dug
1 for
1 their
1 reception
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 found
1 that
1 no
1 fewer
1 than
1 three
1 thousand
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 had
1 fallen
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 also
1 advised
1 the
1 Abeokutans
1 to
1 erect
1 flanking
1 towers
1 at
1 short
1 intervals
1 round
1 their
1 walls
1 to
1 dig
1 a
1 moat
1 twenty
1 feet
1 wide
1 and
1 eight
1 deep
1 at
1 a
1 few
1 yards
1 from
1 their
1 foot
1 and
1 to
1 turn
1 into
1 it
1 the
1 water
1 from
1 the
1 river
1 in
1 order
1 that
1 any
1 future
1 attack
1 might
1 be
1 more
1 easily
1 repelled
1 The
1 inhabitants
1 were
1 poor
1 but
1 they
1 would
1 willingly
1 have
1 presented
1 all
1 their
1 treasures
1 to
1 their
1 white
1 allies
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 however
1 would
1 accept
1 nothing
1 save
1 a
1 few
1 specimens
1 of
1 native
1 cloth
1 exquisitely
1 woven
1 from
1 the
1 inner
1 barks
1 of
1 the
1 trees
1 and
1 some
1 other
1 specimens
1 of
1 choice
1 native
1 workmanship
1 He
1 also
1 begged
1 them
1 to
1 send
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 by
1 the
1 first
1 opportunity
1 the
1 cases
1 of
1 specimens
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 collected
1 since
1 the
1 departure
1 of
1 the
1 Fans
1 A
1 violent
1 attack
1 of
1 fever
1 brought
1 on
1 by
1 their
1 exertions
1 in
1 the
1 sun
1 prostrated
1 both
1 the
1 white
1 travelers
1 a
1 few
1 days
1 after
1 the
1 termination
1 of
1 the
1 siege
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 some
1 weeks
1 before
1 they
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 renew
1 their
1 journey
1 Their
1 intention
1 was
1 to
1 ascend
1 the
1 river
1 for
1 some
1 distance
1 to
1 move
1 westward
1 into
1 upper
1 Ashanti
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 make
1 their
1 way
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 whence
1 they
1 would
1 journey
1 down
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 and
1 there
1 take
1 ship
1 for
1 England
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 travel
1 they
1 took
1 leave
1 of
1 their
1 friends
1 at
1 Abeokuta
1 who
1 furnished
1 them
1 with
1 carriers
1 for
1 their
1 cases
1 and
1 hammock
1 bearers
1 for
1 their
1 journey
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 the
1 Volta
1 This
1 lasted
1 for
1 a
1 fortnight
1 through
1 an
1 open
1 and
1 fertile
1 country
1 Then
1 they
1 crossed
1 the
1 river
1 and
1 entered
1 Ashanti
1 the
1 great
1 rival
1 empire
1 of
1 Dahomey
1 As
1 Ashanti
1 was
1 at
1 peace
1 with
1 England
1 they
1 had
1 now
1 no
1 fear
1 of
1 molestation
1 on
1 their
1 journey
1 Ashanti
1 consisted
1 of
1 five
1 or
1 six
1 kingdoms
1 all
1 of
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 conquered
1 and
1 were
1 tributary
1 to
1 it
1 The
1 empire
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 was
1 separated
1 by
1 the
1 river
1 Prah
1 from
1 the
1 country
1 of
1 the
1 Fantis
1 who
1 lived
1 under
1 British
1 protection
1 The
1 people
1 drew
1 their
1 supplies
1 from
1 various
1 points
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 principally
1 however
1 through
1 Elmina
1 a
1 Dutch
1 settlement
1 five
1 miles
1 to
1 the
1 west
1 of
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 called
1 peaceable
1 neighbors
1 They
1 like
1 the
1 Dahomans
1 delighted
1 in
1 human
1 sacrifices
1 upon
1 a
1 grand
1 scale
1 and
1 to
1 carry
1 these
1 out
1 captives
1 must
1 be
1 taken
1 Consequently
1 every
1 four
1 or
1 five
1 years
1 on
1 some
1 pretext
1 or
1 other
1 they
1 cross
1 the
1 Prah
1 destroyed
1 the
1 villages
1 dragged
1 away
1 the
1 people
1 to
1 slavery
1 or
1 death
1 and
1 carried
1 fire
1 and
1 sword
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 very
1 walls
1 of
1 the
1 English
1 fort
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 Sometimes
1 the
1 English
1 confined

1 to

1 was
1 the

1 a

1 Governor

1 forts
1 to
1 the
1 west
1 of
1 this
1 stream
1 Similarly
1 the
1 protectorate
1 of
1 the
1 tribes
1 inland
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 boundary
1 of
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 kingdom
1 changed
1 hands
1 The
1 natives
1 were
1 not
1 consulted
1 as
1 to
1 this
1 treaty
1 and
1 some
1 of
1 those
1 formerly
1 under
1 British
1 protection
1 especially
1 the
1 natives
1 of
1 Commendah
1 refused
1 to
1 accept
1 the
1 transfer
1 and
1 beat
1 off
1 with
1 loss
1 the
1 Dutch
1 troops
1 who
1 attempted
1 to
1 land
1 The
1 Dutch
1 men
1 of
1 war
1 bombarded
1 and
1 destroyed
1 Commendah
1 This
1 step
1 was
1 the
1 commencement
1 of
1 fresh
1 troubles
1 between
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 and
1 the
1 English
1 The
1 Commendah
1 people
1 were
1 Fantis
1 and
1 as
1 such
1 the
1 implacable
1 enemies
1 of
1 the
1 Elmina
1 people
1 who
1 had
1 under
1 Dutch
1 protection
1 been
1 always
1 allies
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 and
1 had
1 been
1 mainly
1 instrumental
1 in
1 supplying
1 them
1 with
1 arms
1 and
1 ammunition
1 The
1 Fantis
1 regarding
1 the
1 Elmina
1 natives
1 and
1 the
1 Dutch
1 as
1 one
1 power
1 retaliated
1 for
1 the
1 destruction
1 of
1 Commendah
1 by
1 invading
1 the
1 territory
1 of
1 the
1 Elmina
1 tribe
1 destroying
1 their
1 villages
1 and
1 blockading
1 the
1 Dutch
1 in
1 their
1 port
1 Another
1 reason
1 for
1 this
1 attack
1 upon
1 the
1 Elminas
1 was
1 that
1 an
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 named
1 Atjempon
1 had
1 marched
1 with
1 several
1 hundred
1 men
1 through
1 the
1 Fanti
1 country
1 burning
1 destroying
1 and
1 slaying
1 as
1 usual
1 and
1 had
1 taken
1 refuge
1 with
1 his
1 men
1 in
1 Elmina
1 From
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 desultory
1 war
1 between
1 the
1 Elminas
1 and
1 their
1 Ashanti
1 allies
1 and
1 the
1 Fantis
1 of
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 had
1 never
1 ceased
1 Our
1 influence
1 over
1 our
1 allies
1 was
1 but
1 small
1 for
1 we
1 in
1 vain
1 endeavored
1 to
1 persuade
1 them
1 to
1 give
1 up
1 the
1 invasion
1 of
1 Elmina
1 e
1 even
1 cut
1 off
1 the
1 supplies
1 of
1 powder
1 and
1 arms
1 to
1 the
1 Fantis
1 whose
1 loyalty
1 to
1 our
1 rule
1 was
1 thereby
1 much
1 shaken
1 All
1 these
1 troubles
1 induced
1 the
1 Dutch
1 to
1 come
1 to
1 the
1 decision
1 to
1 withdraw
1 altogether
1 and
1 they
1 accordingly
1 offered
1 to
1 transfer
1 all
1 their
1 possessions
1 to
1 us
1 The
1 English
1 government
1 determined
1 not
1 to
1 accept
1 the
1 transfer
1 if
1 it
1 should
1 lead
1 to
1 troubles
1 with
1 the
1 natives
1 and
1 as
1 a
1 first
1 step
1 required
1 that
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 force
1 should
1 leave
1 Elmina
1 In
1 1
1 8
1 7
1 0
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 wrote
1 to
1 us
1 claiming
1 Elmina
1 as
1 his
1 and
1 protesting
1 against
1 its
1 being
1 handed
1 over
1 to
1 us
1 According
1 to
1 native
1 ideas
1 the
1 king
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 s
1 claim
1 was
1 a
1 just
1 one
1 The
1 land
1 upon
1 which
1 all
1 the
1 forts
1 English
1 Dutch
1 Danish
1 and
1 French
1 were
1 built
1 had
1 been
1 originally
1 acquired
1 from
1 the
1 native
1 chiefs
1 at
1 a
1 fixed
1 annual
1 tribute
1 or
1 as
1 we
1 regarded
1 it
1 as
1 rent
1 or
1 as
1 an
1 annual
1 present
1 in
1 return
1 for
1 friendly
1 relations
1 By
1 the
1 native
1 customs
1 he
1 who
1 conquers
1 a
1 chief
1 entitled
1 to
1 such
1 a
1 payment
1 becomes
1 the
1 heir
1 of
1 that
1 payment
1 and
1 one
1 time
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 upon
1 the
1 strength
1 of
1 his
1 conquest
1 of
1 the
1 Fantis
1 set
1 up
1 a
1 claim
1 of
1 proprietorship
1 over
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 and
1 the
1 other
1 British
1 forts
1 Of
1 a
1 similar
1 nature
1 was
1 the
1 claim
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 upon
1 Elmina
1 The
1 Dutch
1 had
1 paid
1 eighty
1 pounds
1 a
1 year
1 as
1 they
1 asserted
1 as
1 a
1 present
1 and
1 they
1 proved
1 conclusively
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 never
1 regarded
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 as
1 having
1 sovereignty
1 over
1 their
1 forts
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 never
1 advanced
1 such
1 a
1 claim
1 They
1 now
1 arrested
1 Atjempon
1 and
1 refused
1 to
1 pay
1 a
1 further
1 sum
1 to
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 until
1 he
1 withdrew
1 his
1 claim
1 In
1 order
1 to
1 settle
1 matters
1 amicably
1 they
1 sent
1 an
1 envoy
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 with
1 presents
1 for
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 obtained
1 from
1 him
1 a
1 repudiation
1 of
1 his
1 former
1 letter
1 and
1 a
1 solemn
1 acknowledgment
1 that
1 the
1 money
1 was
1 not
1 paid
1 as
1 a
1 tribute
1 The
1 king
1 sent
1 down
1 two
1 ambassadors
1 to
1 Elmina
1 who
1 solemnly
1 ratified
1 this
1 declaration
1 The
1 transfer
1 was
1 then
1 effected
1 e
1 purchased
1 from
1 the
1 Dutch
1 their
1 forts
1 and
1 stores
1 but
1 the
1 people
1 of
1 Elmina
1 were
1 told
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 not
1 take
1 possession
1 of
1 the
1 place
1 except
1 with
1 their
1 consent
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 pointed

1 to
1 them
1 that

1 protection
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 exposed
1 as
1 before
1 to
1 the
1 hostility
1 of
1 the
1 Fantis
1 They
1 agreed
1 to
1 accept
1 our
1 offer
1 and

1 the
1 4th
1 of

1 a
1 grand
1 council
1 was
1 hold
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 chiefs
1 of
1 Elmina
1 announced
1 the
1 agreement
1 of
1 their
1 people
1 to
1 the
1 transfer
1 and
1 we
1 took
1 possession
1 of
1 Elmina
1 Atjempon
1 and
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 returning
1 to
1 their
1 own
1 country
1 Upon
1 the
1 transfer
1 taking
1 place
1 Mr
1 Pope
1 Hennessey
1 the
1 governor
1 of
1 the
1 colony
1 sent
1 to
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 saying
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 desired
1 peace
1 and
1 friendship
1 with
1 the
1 natives
1 and
1 would
1 give
1 an
1 annual
1 present
1 double
1 that
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 received
1 from
1 the
1 Dutch
1 At
1 the
1 same
1 time
1 negotiations
1 were
1 going
1 on
1 with
1 the
1 king
1 for
1 the
1 free
1 passage
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 traders
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 release
1 of
1 four
1 Germans
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 carried
1 off
1 ten
1 years
1 before
1 by
1 Aboo
1 Boffoo
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 generals
1 from
1 their
1 mission
1 station
1 on
1 British
1 territory
1 near
1 the
1 Volta
1 The
1 king
1 wrote
1 saying
1 that
1 Aboo
1 Boffoo
1 would
1 not
1 give
1 them
1 up
1 without
1 a
1 ransom
1 of
1 eighteen
1 hundred
1 ounces
1 of
1 gold
1 and
1 protracted
1 negotiations
1 went
1 on
1 concerning
1 the
1 payments
1 of
1 these
1 sums
1 At
1 the
1 time
1 when
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 had
1 landed
1 on
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 early
1 in
1 1
1 8
1 7
1 2
1 nothing
1 was
1 known
1 of
1 any
1 anticipated
1 troubles
1 with
1 Ashanti
1 The
1 negotiations
1 between
1 the
1 English
1 and
1 the
1 Dutch
1 were
1 in
1 progress
1 but
1 they
1 had
1 heard
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 would
1 not
1 take
1 over
1 Elmina
1 without
1 the
1 consent
1 of
1 the
1 inhabitants
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 be
1 willing
1 to
1 increase
1 the
1 payment
1 made
1 by
1 the
1 Dutch
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 It
1 was
1 known
1 too
1 that
1 efforts
1 would
1 be
1 made
1 to
1 settle
1 all
1 points
1 of
1 difference
1 with
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 as
1 at
1 Abeokuta
1 they
1 received
1 news
1 that
1 the
1 negotiations
1 were
1 going
1 on
1 satisfactorily
1 and
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 prospect
1 whatever
1 of
1 trouble
1 they
1 did
1 not
1 hesitate
1 to
1 carry
1 out
1 the
1 plans
1 they
1 had
1 formed
1 Before
1 crossing
1 the
1 Volta
1 they
1 sent
1 across
1 to
1 inquire
1 of
1 the
1 chief
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 there
1 whether
1 two
1 English
1 travelers
1 would
1 be
1 allowed
1 to
1 pass
1 through
1 Ashanti
1 and
1 were
1 delayed
1 for
1 a
1 fortnight
1 until
1 a
1 messenger
1 was
1 sent
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 and
1 returned
1 with
1 a
1 letter
1 saying
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 would
1 be
1 glad
1 to
1 see
1 white
1 men
1 at
1 his
1 capital
1 ith
1 this
1 assurance
1 they
1 crossed
1 the
1 stream
1 They
1 were
1 received
1 in
1 state
1 by
1 the
1 chief
1 who
1 at
1 once
1 provided
1 them
1 with
1 the
1 necessary
1 carriers
1 and
1 with
1 them
1 a
1 guard
1 which
1 he
1 said
1 would
1 prevent
1 any
1 trouble
1 on
1 their
1 way
1 On
1 the
1 following
1 day
1 they
1 started
1 and
1 after
1 arriving
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 a
1 day
1 s
1 journey
1 at
1 a
1 village
1 prepared
1 to
1 stop
1 as
1 usual
1 for
1 a
1 day
1 or
1 two
1 to
1 add
1 to
1 their
1 collection
1 The
1 officer
1 of
1 the
1 guard
1 however
1 explained
1 to
1 them
1 through
1 Bacon
1 who
1 spoke
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 language
1 that
1 his
1 instructions
1 were
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 to
1 go
1 straight
1 through
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 In
1 vain
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 protested
1 that
1 this
1 would
1 entirely
1 defeat
1 the
1 object
1 of
1 his
1 journey
1 The
1 officer
1 was
1 firm
1 His
1 orders
1 were
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 to
1 travel
1 straight
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 and
1 if
1 he
1 failed
1 in
1 carrying
1 these
1 out
1 his
1 head
1 would
1 assuredly
1 be
1 forfeited
1 This
1 is
1 serious
1 Frank
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 If
1 this
1 fellow
1 has
1 not
1 blundered
1 about
1 his
1 orders
1 it
1 is
1 clear
1 that
1 we
1 are
1 prisoners
1 However
1 it
1 may
1 be
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 merely
1 gave
1 a
1 direction
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 be
1 escorted
1 to
1 the
1 capital
1 having
1 no
1 idea
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 want
1 to
1 loiter
1 upon
1 the
1 way
1 They
1 now
1 proceeded
1 steadily
1 forward
1 making
1 long
1 day
1 s
1 marches
1 The
1 officer
1 in
1 command
1 of
1 the
1 guard
1 was
1 most
1 civil
1 obtaining
1 for
1 them
1 an
1 abundance
1 of
1 provisions
1 at
1 the
1 villages
1 at
1 which
1 they
1 stopped
1 and
1 as
1 Frank
1 and
1 his
1 companion
1 were
1 both
1 weakened
1 by
1 fever
1 he
1 enlisted
1 sufficient
1 hammock
1 bearers
1 for
1 them
1 taking
1 fresh
1 relays
1 from
1 each
1 village
1 He
1 would
1 not
1 hear
1 of
1 their
1 paying
1 either
1 for
1 provisions
1 or
1 bearers
1 saying
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 guests
1 and
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 an
1 insult
1 to
1 him
1 were
1 they
1 to
1 pay
1 for
1 anything
1 Ten
1 days
1 after
1 starting
1 from
1 the
1 Volta
1 they
1 entered
1 Coomassie
1 This
1 town
1 lay
1 on
1 rising
1 ground
1 surrounded
1 by
1 a
1 deep
1 marsh
1 of
1 from
1 forty
1 to
1 a
1 hundred
1 yards
1 wide
1 A
1 messenger
1 had
1 been
1 sent
1 on
1 in
1 front
1 to
1 announce
1 their
1 coming
1 and
1 after
1 crossing
1 the
1 marsh
1 they
1 passed
1 under
1 a
1 great
1 fetish
1 or
1 spell
1 consisting
1 of
1 a
1 dead
1 sheep
1 wrapped
1 up
1 in
1 red
1 silk
1 and
1 suspended
1 from
1 two
1 poles
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 at
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 procession
1 On
1 entering
1 the
1 town
1 they
1 were
1 met
1 by
1 a
1 crowd
1 of
1 at

1 five
1 thousand
1 people
1 for
1 the
1 most
1 part
1 warriors
1 who
1 fired
1 their
1 guns
1 shouted
1 and
1 yelled
1 Horns
1 drums
1 rattles
1 and
1 gongs
1 added
1 to
1 the
1 appalling
1 noise
1 Men
1 with
1 flags
1 performed
1 wild
1 dances
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 warriors
1 joined
1 The
1 dress
1 of

1 and
1 immense
1 plumes
1 of
1 eagles
1 feathers
1 on

1 side
1 Their
1 vest
1 was
1 of

1 cloth
1 covered
1 with
1 fetishes
1 and
1 charms
1 in
1 cases
1 of
1 gold
1 silver

1 with
1 the

1 the
1 party
1 moved
1 forward
1 slowly
1 the
1 throng
1 thickening
1 at

1 They
1 were
1 escorted
1 to
1 a

1 the
1 door
1 led
1 into
1 an
1 open
1 courtyard
1 of
1 some
1 twelve
1 feet
1 in
1 diameter
1 On
1 each
1 side
1 of
1 this
1 was
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 alcove
1 built
1 up
1 of
1 clay
1 about
1 three
1 feet
1 from
1 the

1 This
1 formed
1 a

1 some
1 eight
1 feet
1 long
1 by
1 three
1 feet
1 high
1 with
1 a

1 Beyond

1 A
1 sheep
1 and
1 a

1 of
1 vegetables
1 and
1 fruits
1 were
1 sent
1 in
1 in
1 the
1 course
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 but
1 they
1 were
1 told
1 not
1 to
1 show
1 themselves
1 in
1 the
1 streets
1 until
1 they
1 had
1 seen
1 the
1 king
1 e
1 shall
1 be
1 expected
1 to
1 make
1 his
1 majesty
1 a
1 handsome
1 present
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 and
1 unfortunately
1 our
1 stores
1 were
1 not
1 intended
1 for
1 so
1 great
1 a
1 potentate
1 I
1 will
1 give
1 him
1 my
1 double
1 barreled
1 rifle
1 and
1 your
1 inchester
1 Frank
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 suppose
1 he
1 has
1 seen
1 such
1 an
1 arm
1 e
1 had
1 better
1 get
1 them
1 cleaned
1 up
1 and
1 polished
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 look
1 as
1 handsome
1 as
1 possible
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 captains
1 came
1 and
1 said
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 was
1 in
1 readiness
1 to
1 receive
1 them
1 and
1 they
1 made
1 their
1 way
1 through
1 a
1 vast
1 crowd
1 to
1 the
1 marketplace
1 an
1 open
1 area
1 nearly
1 half
1 a
1 mile
1 in
1 extent
1 The
1 sun
1 was
1 shining
1 brightly
1 and
1 the
1 scene
1 was
1 a
1 brilliant
1 one
1 The
1 king
1 his
1 Caboceers
1 or
1 great
1 tributaries
1 his
1 captains
1 and
1 officers
1 were
1 seated
1 under
1 a
1 vast
1 number
1 of
1 huge
1 umbrellas
1 some
1 of
1 them
1 fifteen
1 feet
1 across
1 These
1 were
1 of
1 scarlet
1 yellow
1 and
1 other
1 showy
1 colors
1 in
1 silks
1 and
1 cloths
1 with
1 fantastically
1 scalloped
1 and
1 fringed
1 valences
1 They
1 were
1 surmounted
1 with
1 crescents
1 birds
1 elephants
1 barrels
1 and
1 swords
1 of
1 gold
1 and
1 on
1 some
1 were
1 couched
1 stuffed
1 animals
1 Innumerable
1 smaller
1 umbrellas
1 of
1 striped
1 stuff
1 were
1 borne
1 by
1 the
1 crowd
1 and
1 all
1 these
1 were
1 waved
1 up
1 and
1 down
1 while
1 a
1 vast
1 number
1 of
1 flutes
1 horns
1 and
1 other
1 musical
1 instruments
1 sounded
1 in
1 the
1 air
1 All
1 the
1 principal
1 people
1 wore
1 robes
1 woven
1 of
1 foreign
1 silk
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 unraveled
1 for
1 working
1 into
1 native
1 patterns
1 All
1 had
1 golden
1 necklaces
1 and
1 bracelets
1 in
1 many
1 cases
1 so
1 heavy
1 that
1 the
1 arms
1 of
1 the
1 bearers
1 were
1 supported
1 on
1 boys
1 heads
1 The
1 whole
1 crowd
1 many
1 thousands
1 in
1 number
1 shone
1 with
1 gold
1 silver
1 and
1 bright
1 colors
1 The
1 king
1 received
1 them
1 with
1 dignity
1 and
1 expressed
1 his
1 satisfaction
1 at
1 seeing
1 them
1 his
1 speech
1 being
1 interpreted
1 by
1 one
1 of
1 his
1 attendants
1 who
1 spoke
1 English
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 replied
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 very
1 great
1 pleasure
1 in
1 visiting
1 the
1 court
1 of
1 his
1 majesty
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 already
1 been
1 traveling
1 for
1 many
1 months
1 in
1 Africa
1 having
1 started
1 from
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 and
1 traveled
1 through
1 many
1 tribes
1 but
1 had
1 they
1 had
1 any
1 idea
1 of
1 visiting
1 so
1 great
1 a
1 king
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 provided
1 themselves
1 with
1 presents
1 fit
1 for
1 his
1 acceptance
1 But
1 they
1 were
1 simple
1 travelers
1 catching
1 the
1 birds
1 beasts
1 and
1 insects
1 of
1 the
1 country
1 to
1 take
1 home
1 with
1 them
1 to
1 show
1 to
1 the
1 people
1 in
1 England
1 The
1 only
1 things
1 which
1 they
1 could
1 offer
1 him
1 were
1 a
1 double
1 barreled
1 breech
1 loading
1 rifle
1 of
1 the
1 best
1 English
1 construction
1 and
1 a
1 little
1 gun
1 which
1 would
1 fire
1 sixteen
1 times
1 without
1 loading
1 The
1 king
1 examined
1 the
1 pieces
1 with
1 great
1 attention
1 and
1 at
1 his
1 request
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 fired
1 off
1 the
1 whole
1 contents
1 of
1 the
1 magazine
1 of
1 the
1 repeating
1 rifle
1 whose
1 action
1 caused
1 the
1 greatest
1 astonishment
1 to
1 the
1 assembled
1 chiefs
1 The
1 king
1 then
1 intimated
1 his
1 acceptance
1 of
1 the
1 presents
1 and
1 said
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 speak
1 farther
1 with
1 them
1 on
1 a
1 future
1 occasion
1 He
1 informed
1 them
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 free
1 to
1 move
1 about
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 where
1 they
1 wished
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 greatest
1 respect
1 would
1 be
1 shown
1 to
1 them
1 by
1 the
1 people
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 fresh
1 outburst
1 of
1 wild
1 music
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 then
1 conducted
1 back
1 to
1 their
1 house
1 After
1 the
1 assembly
1 had
1 dispersed
1 the
1 two
1 Englishmen
1 walked
1 about
1 through
1 the
1 town
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 of
1 great
1 extent
1 but
1 the
1 streets
1 were
1 broad
1 and
1 well
1 kept
1 Many
1 of
1 the
1 houses
1 were
1 much
1 larger
1 than
1 that
1 allotted
1 to
1 them
1 but
1 all
1 were
1 built
1 on
1 the
1 same
1 plan
1 It
1 was
1 evident
1 that
1 the
1 great
1 mass
1 of
1 the
1 population
1 they
1 saw
1 about
1 must
1 live
1 in
1 villages
1 scattered
1 around
1 the
1 town
1 being
1 wholly
1 insufficient
1 to
1 contain
1 them
1 Three
1 days
1 afterwards
1 they
1 were
1 told
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 wished
1 to
1 see
1 them
1 in
1 his
1 palace
1 This
1 was
1 a
1 large
1 building
1 situated
1 at
1 the
1 extremity
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 It
1 was
1 constructed
1 of
1 stone
1 and
1 was
1 evidently
1 built
1 from
1 European
1 designs
1 It
1 was
1 square
1 with
1 a
1 flat
1 roof
1 and
1 embattled
1 parapet
1 They
1 were
1 conducted
1 through
1 the
1 gateway
1 into
1 a
1 large
1 courtyard
1 and
1 then
1 into
1 a
1 hall
1 where
1 the
1 king
1 sat
1 upon
1 a
1 raised
1 throne
1 Attendants
1 stood
1 round
1 fanning
1 him
1 hy
1 he
1 asked
1 abruptly
1 as
1 they
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 before
1 him
1 do
1 the
1 English
1 take
1 my
1 town
1 of
1 Elmina
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 explained
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 nine
1 months
1 absent
1 from
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 that
1 having
1 come
1 straight
1 out
1 from
1 England
1 he
1 was
1 altogether
1 unaware
1 of
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 at
1 Elmina
1 Elmina
1 is
1 mine
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 The
1 Dutch
1 who
1 were
1 my
1 tributaries
1 had
1 no
1 right
1 to
1 hand
1 it
1 over
1 to
1 the
1 English
1 But
1 I
1 understood
1 your
1 majesty
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 were
1 ready
1 to
1 pay
1 an
1 annual
1 sum
1 even
1 larger
1 than
1 that
1 which
1 the
1 Dutch
1 have
1 contributed
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 want
1 money
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 gold
1 in
1 plenty
1 There
1 are
1 places
1 in
1 my
1 dominions
1 where
1 ten
1 men
1 in
1 a
1 day
1 can
1 wash
1 a
1 thousand
1 ounces
1 I
1 want
1 Elmina
1 I
1 want
1 to
1 trade
1 with
1 the
1 coast
1 But
1 the
1 English
1 will
1 give
1 your
1 majesty
1 every
1 facility
1 for
1 trade
1 But
1 suppose
1 we
1 quarrel
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 they
1 can
1 stop
1 powder
1 and
1 guns
1 from
1 coming
1 up
1 If
1 Elmina
1 were
1 mine
1 I
1 could
1 bring
1 up
1 guns
1 and
1 powder
1 at
1 all
1 times
1 Your
1 majesty
1 would
1 be
1 no
1 better
1 off
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 for
1 the
1 English
1 in
1 case
1 of
1 war
1 could
1 stop
1 supplies
1 from
1 entering
1 My
1 people
1 will
1 drive
1 them
1 into
1 the
1 sea
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 e
1 have
1 been
1 troubled
1 with
1 them
1 too
1 long
1 They
1 can
1 make
1 guns
1 but
1 they
1 cannot
1 fight
1 My
1 people
1 will
1 eat
1 them
1 up
1 e
1 fought
1 them
1 before
1 and
1 see
1 he
1 said
1 pointing
1 to
1 a
1 great
1 drum
1 from
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 which
1 hung
1 a
1 dozen
1 human
1 skulls
1 the
1 heads
1 of
1 the
1 hite
1 men
1 serve
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 fetish
1 for
1 me
1 He
1 then
1 waved
1 his
1 hand
1 to
1 signify
1 that
1 the
1 audience
1 was
1 terminated
1 Things
1 look
1 bad
1 Frank
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 as
1 they
1 walked
1 towards
1 their
1 home
1 I
1 fear
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 is
1 determined
1 upon
1 war
1 and
1 if
1 so
1 our
1 lives
1 are
1 not
1 worth
1 a
1 month
1 s
1 purchase
1 It
1 can
1 t
1 be
1 helped
1 Frank
1 said
1 as
1 cheerfully
1 as
1 he
1 could
1 e
1 must
1 make
1 the
1 best
1 of
1 it
1 Perhaps
1 something
1 may
1 occur
1 to
1 improve
1 our
1 position
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 the
1 four
1 German
1 missionaries
1 who
1 had
1 so
1 long
1 been
1 kept
1 captive
1 called
1 upon
1 them
1 and
1 they
1 obtained
1 a
1 full
1 insight
1 into
1 the
1 position
1 This
1 seemed
1 more
1 hopeful
1 than
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 words
1 had
1 given
1 them
1 to
1 expect
1 The
1 missionaries
1 said
1 that
1 negotiations
1 were
1 going
1 on
1 for
1 their
1 release
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 expected
1 very
1 shortly
1 to
1 be
1 sent
1 down
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 So
1 far
1 as
1 they
1 knew
1 everything
1 was
1 being
1 done
1 by
1 the
1 English
1 to
1 satisfy
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 they
1 looked
1 upon
1 the
1 establishment
1 of
1 peace
1 as
1 certain
1 They
1 described
1 the
1 horrible
1 rites
1 and
1 sacrifices
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 been
1 compelled
1 to
1 witness
1 and
1 said
1 that
1 at
1 least
1 three
1 thousand
1 persons
1 were
1 slaughtered
1 annually
1 in
1 Coomassie
1 You
1 noticed
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 said
1 the
1 great
1 tree
1 in
1 the
1 marketplace
1 under
1 which
1 the
1 king
1 sat
1 That
1 is
1 the
1 great
1 fetish
1 tree
1 A
1 great
1 many
1 victims
1 are
1 sacrificed
1 in
1 the
1 palace
1 itself
1 but
1 the
1 wholesale
1 slaughters
1 take
1 place
1 there
1 The
1 high
1 brushwood
1 comes
1 up
1 to
1 within
1 twenty
1 yards
1 of
1 it
1 and
1 if
1 you
1 turn
1 in
1 there
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 thousands
1 of
1 dead
1 bodies
1 or
1 their
1 remains
1 putrefying
1 together
1 I
1 thought
1 I
1 felt
1 a
1 horribly
1 offensive
1 smell
1 as
1 I
1 was
1 talking
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 Frank
1 said
1 shuddering
1 hat
1 monsters
1 these
1 people
1 must
1 be
1 ho
1 would
1 have
1 thought
1 that
1 all
1 that
1 show
1 of
1 gold
1 and
1 silver
1 and
1 silks
1 and
1 bright
1 colors
1 covered
1 such
1 horrible
1 barbarism
1 After
1 chatting
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 longer
1 and
1 offering
1 to
1 do
1 anything
1 in
1 their
1 power
1 to
1 assist
1 the
1 captives
1 the
1 Germans
1 took

1 CHAPTER
1 XVII
1 THE
1 INVASION
1 OF
1 FANTI
1 LAND
1 The
1 following
1 morning
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 and
1 Frank
1 were
1 called
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 by
1 the
1 noise
1 of
1 a
1 passing
1 crowd
1 and
1 to
1 their
1 horror
1 saw
1 a
1 man
1 being
1 taken
1 to
1 sacrifice
1 He
1 was
1 preceded
1 by
1 men
1 beating
1 drums
1 his
1 hands
1 were
1 pinioned
1 behind
1 him
1 A
1 sharp
1 thin
1 knife
1 was
1 passed
1 through
1 his
1 cheeks
1 to
1 which
1 his
1 lips
1 were
1 noozed
1 like
1 the
1 figure
1 8
1 One
1 ear
1 was
1 cut
1 off
1 and
1 carried
1 before
1 him
1 the
1 other
1 hung
1 to
1 his
1 head
1 by
1 a
1 small
1 piece
1 of
1 skin
1 There
1 were
1 several
1 gashes
1 in
1 his
1 back
1 and
1 a
1 knife
1 was
1 thrust
1 under
1 each
1 shoulder
1 blade
1 He
1 was
1 led
1 by
1 a
1 cord
1 passed
1 through
1 a
1 hole
1 bored
1 in
1 his
1 nose
1 Frank
1 ran
1 horror
1 stricken
1 back
1 into
1 the
1 house
1 and
1 sat
1 for
1 a
1 while
1 with
1 his
1 hand
1 over
1 his
1 eyes
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 shut
1 out
1 the
1 ghastly
1 spectacle
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 he
1 said
1 presently
1 if
1 we
1 are
1 to
1 be
1 killed
1 at
1 least
1 let
1 us
1 die
1 fighting
1 to
1 the
1 last
1 and
1 blow
1 out
1 our
1 own
1 brains
1 with
1 the
1 last
1 shots
1 we
1 have
1 left
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 I
1 m
1 afraid
1 of
1 being
1 killed
1 but
1 to
1 be
1 tortured
1 like
1 that
1 would
1 be
1 horrible
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 a
1 message
1 was
1 brought
1 them
1 that
1 their
1 retaining
1 private
1 guards
1 was
1 an
1 insult
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 Houssas
1 must
1 remove
1 to
1 another
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 Resistance
1 was
1 evidently
1 useless
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 called
1 his
1 four
1 men
1 together
1 and
1 told
1 them
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 I
1 am
1 sorry
1 I
1 have
1 brought
1 you
1 into
1 this
1 plight
1 my
1 poor
1 fellows
1 he
1 said
1 There
1 are
1 now
1 but
1 two
1 things
1 open
1 to
1 you
1 You
1 can
1 either
1 volunteer
1 to
1 join
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 army
1 and
1 then
1 try
1 to
1 make
1 your
1 escape
1 as
1 an
1 opportunity
1 may
1 offer
1 or
1 slip
1 away
1 at
1 once
1 You
1 are
1 accustomed
1 to
1 the
1 woods
1 and
1 in
1 native
1 costume
1 might
1 pass
1 without
1 notice
1 You
1 can
1 all
1 swim
1 and
1 it
1 matters
1 not
1 where
1 you
1 strike
1 the
1 Prah
1 If
1 you
1 travel
1 at
1 night
1 and
1 lie
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 by
1 day
1 you
1 should
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 get
1 through
1 At
1 any
1 rate
1 you
1 know
1 that
1 if
1 you
1 try
1 to
1 escape
1 and
1 are
1 caught
1 you
1 will
1 be
1 killed
1 If
1 you
1 stop
1 here
1 it
1 is
1 possible
1 that
1 no
1 harm
1 may
1 happen
1 to
1 you
1 but
1 on
1 the
1 other
1 hand
1 you
1 may
1 at
1 any
1 moment
1 be
1 led
1 out
1 to
1 sacrifice
1 Do
1 not
1 tell
1 me
1 your
1 decision
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 questioned
1 and
1 would
1 rather
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 say
1 that
1 I
1 was
1 ignorant
1 that
1 you
1 intended
1 to
1 escape
1 There
1 is
1 one
1 other
1 thing
1 to
1 settle
1 There
1 is
1 a
1 long
1 arrear
1 of
1 pay
1 due
1 to
1 you
1 for
1 your
1 good
1 and
1 faithful
1 service
1 It
1 would
1 be
1 useless
1 for
1 me
1 to
1 pay
1 you
1 now
1 as
1 the
1 money
1 might
1 be
1 found
1 on
1 you
1 and
1 taken
1 away
1 and
1 if
1 you
1 should
1 be
1 killed
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 lost
1 to
1 your
1 friends
1 I
1 have
1 written
1 here
1 four
1 orders
1 on
1 my
1 banker
1 in
1 England
1 which
1 the
1 agents
1 down
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 will
1 readily
1 cash
1 for
1 you
1 Each
1 order
1 is
1 for
1 twice
1 the
1 sum
1 due
1 to
1 you
1 As
1 you
1 have
1 come
1 into
1 such
1 great
1 danger
1 in
1 my
1 service
1 and
1 have
1 behaved
1 so
1 faithfully
1 it
1 is
1 right
1 that
1 you
1 should
1 be
1 well
1 rewarded
1 Give
1 me
1 the
1 names
1 of
1 your
1 wives
1 or
1 relatives
1 whom
1 you
1 wish
1 to
1 have
1 the
1 money
1 Should
1 any
1 of
1 you
1 fall
1 and
1 escape
1 I
1 will
1 on
1 my
1 arrival
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 send
1 money
1 double
1 the
1 amount
1 I
1 have
1 written
1 here
1 to
1 them
1 The
1 men
1 expressed
1 themselves
1 warmly
1 grateful
1 for
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 kindness
1 gave
1 him
1 the
1 names
1 and
1 addresses
1 of
1 their
1 wives
1 and
1 then
1 with
1 tears
1 in
1 their
1 eyes
1 took
1 their
1 leave
1 Now
1 Ostik
1 what
1 do
1 you
1 say
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 asked
1 turning
1 to
1 him
1 I
1 stay
1 here
1 sar
1 Ostik

1 Ostik
1 if

1 through
1 safe
1 together
1 you
1 shall
1 not
1 have
1 reason
1 to
1 regret
1 your
1 fidelity
1 Now
1 Frank
1 I
1 think
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 good
1 thing
1 if
1 you
1 were
1 to
1 spend
1 some
1 hours
1 every
1 day
1 in
1 trying
1 to
1 pick
1 up
1 as
1 much
1 of
1 the
1 language
1 here
1 as
1 you
1 can
1 You
1 are
1 quick
1 at
1 it
1 and
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 make
1 yourself
1 understood
1 by
1 our
1 bearers
1 far
1 better
1 than
1 I
1 could
1 do
1 You
1 already
1 know
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 words
1 in
1 four
1 or
1 five
1 of
1 these
1 dialects
1 They
1 are
1 all
1 related
1 to
1 each
1 other
1 and
1 with
1 what
1 you
1 know
1 you
1 would
1 in
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 months
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 get
1 along
1 very
1 well
1 in
1 Ashanti
1 It
1 will
1 help
1 to
1 pass
1 your
1 time
1 and
1 to
1 occupy
1 your
1 mind
1 There
1 will
1 be
1 no
1 difficulty
1 in
1 finding
1 men
1 here
1 who
1 have
1 worked
1 down
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 know
1 a
1 little
1 English
1 If
1 we
1 get
1 away
1 safely
1 you
1 will
1 not
1 regret
1 that
1 your
1 time
1 has
1 been
1 employed
1 If
1 we
1 have
1 trouble
1 your
1 knowledge
1 of
1 the
1 language
1 may
1 in
1 some
1 way
1 or
1 other
1 be
1 of
1 real
1 use
1 to
1 you
1 e
1 can
1 go
1 round
1 to
1 the
1 Germans
1 who
1 will
1 no
1 doubt
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 put
1 you
1 in
1 the
1 way
1 of
1 getting
1 a
1 man
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 they
1 were
1 again
1 sent
1 for
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 who
1 was
1 in
1 a
1 high
1 state
1 of
1 anger
1 at
1 having
1 heard
1 that
1 the
1 Houssas
1 had
1 escaped
1 I
1 know
1 nothing
1 about
1 it
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 They
1 were
1 contented
1 when
1 they
1 were
1 with
1 me
1 and
1 had
1 no
1 wish
1 to
1 go
1 Your
1 soldiers
1 took
1 them
1 away
1 yesterday
1 afternoon
1 and
1 I
1 suppose
1 they
1 were
1 frightened
1 It
1 was
1 foolish
1 of
1 them
1 They
1 should
1 have
1 known
1 that
1 a
1 great
1 king
1 does
1 not
1 injure
1 travelers
1 who
1 come
1 peacefully
1 into
1 his
1 country
1 They
1 should
1 have
1 known
1 better
1 They
1 were
1 poor
1 ignorant
1 men
1 who
1 did
1 not
1 know
1 that
1 the
1 hospitality
1 of
1 a
1 king
1 is
1 sacred
1 and
1 that
1 when
1 a
1 king
1 invites
1 travelers
1 to
1 enter
1 his
1 country
1 they
1 are
1 his
1 guests
1 and
1 under
1 his
1 protection
1 hen
1 the
1 interpreter
1 translated
1 this
1 speech
1 the
1 king
1 was
1 silent
1 for
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 minutes
1 Then
1 he
1 said
1 My
1 white
1 friend
1 is
1 right
1 They
1 were
1 foolish
1 men
1 They
1 could
1 not
1 know
1 these
1 things
1 If
1 my
1 warriors
1 overtake
1 them
1 no
1 harm
1 shall
1 come
1 to
1 them
1 Pleased
1 with
1 the
1 impression
1 that
1 his
1 words
1 had
1 evidently
1 made
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 returned
1 to
1 Frank
1 who
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 ordered
1 to
1 accompany
1 him
1 to
1 the
1 palace
1 In
1 the
1 afternoon
1 the
1 king
1 sent
1 a
1 sheep
1 and
1 a
1 present
1 of
1 five
1 ounces
1 of
1 gold
1 and
1 a
1 message
1 that
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 wish
1 his
1 white
1 friends
1 to
1 remain
1 always
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 but
1 that
1 they
1 might
1 walk
1 to
1 any
1 of
1 the
1 villages
1 within
1 a
1 circle
1 of
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 miles
1 and
1 that
1 four
1 of
1 his
1 guards
1 would
1 always
1 accompany
1 them
1 to
1 see
1 that
1 no
1 one
1 interfered
1 with
1 or
1 insulted
1 them
1 They
1 were
1 much
1 pleased
1 with
1 this
1 permission
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 now
1 enabled
1 to
1 renew
1 their
1 work
1 of
1 collecting
1 It
1 took
1 them
1 too
1 away
1 from
1 the
1 sight
1 of
1 the
1 horrible
1 human
1 sacrifices
1 which
1 went
1 on
1 daily
1 Through
1 the
1 German
1 missionaries
1 they
1 obtained
1 a
1 man
1 who
1 had
1 worked
1 for
1 three
1 years
1 down
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 He
1 accompanied
1 them
1 on
1 their
1 walks
1 and
1 in
1 the
1 evening
1 sat
1 and
1 talked
1 with
1 Frank
1 who
1 from
1 the
1 knowledge
1 of
1 native
1 words
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 picked
1 up
1 in
1 his
1 nine
1 months
1 residence
1 in
1 Africa
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 make
1 rapid
1 progress
1 in
1 Ashanti
1 He
1 had
1 one
1 or
1 two
1 slight
1 attacks
1 of
1 fever
1 but
1 the
1 constant
1 use
1 of
1 quinine
1 enabled
1 him
1 to
1 resist
1 their
1 effect
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 now
1 to
1 some
1 degree
1 acclimatized
1 and
1 thought
1 no
1 more
1 of
1 the
1 attacks
1 of
1 fever
1 than
1 he
1 would
1 have
1 done
1 at
1 home
1 of
1 a
1 violent
1 bilious
1 attack
1 This
1 was
1 not
1 the
1 case
1 with
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 Frank
1 observed
1 with
1 concern
1 that
1 he
1 lost
1 strength
1 rapidly
1 and
1 was
1 soon
1 unable
1 to
1 accompany
1 him
1 in
1 his
1 walks
1 One
1 morning
1 he
1 appeared
1 very
1 ill
1 Have
1 you
1 a
1 touch
1 of
1 fever
1 sir
1 No
1 Frank
1 it
1 is
1 worse
1 than
1 fever
1 it
1 is
1 dysentery
1 I
1 had
1 an
1 attack
1 last
1 time
1 I
1 was
1 on
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 know
1 what
1 to
1 do
1 with
1 it
1 Get
1 the
1 medicine
1 chest
1 and
1 bring
1 me
1 the
1 bottle
1 of
1 ipecacuanha
1 Now
1 you
1 must
1 give
1 me
1 doses
1 of
1 this
1 just
1 strong
1 enough
1 not
1 to
1 act
1 as
1 an
1 emetic
1 every
1 three
1 hours
1 Frank
1 nursed
1 his
1 friend
1 assiduously
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 three
1 days
1 hoped
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 obtaining
1 a
1 mastery
1 over
1 the
1 illness
1 On
1 the
1 fourth
1 day
1 an
1 attack
1 of
1 fever
1 set
1 in
1 You
1 must
1 stop
1 the
1 ipecacuanha
1 now
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 said
1 and
1 Frank
1 send
1 Ostik
1 round
1 to
1 the
1 Germans
1 and
1 say
1 I
1 wish
1 them
1 to
1 come
1 here
1 at
1 once
1 hen
1 these
1 arrived
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 asked
1 Frank
1 to
1 leave
1 him
1 alone
1 with
1 them
1 A
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 later
1 they
1 went
1 out
1 and
1 Frank
1 returning
1 found
1 two
1 sealed
1 envelopes
1 on
1 the
1 table
1 beside
1 him
1 My
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 making
1 my
1 will
1 I
1 fear
1 that
1 it
1 is
1 all
1 over
1 with
1 me
1 Fever
1 and
1 dysentery
1 together
1 are
1 in
1 nine
1 cases
1 out
1 of
1 ten
1 fatal
1 Don
1 t
1 cry
1 Frank
1 he
1 said
1 as
1 the
1 lad
1 burst
1 into
1 tears
1 I
1 would
1 gladly
1 have
1 lived
1 but
1 if
1 it
1 is
1 God
1 s
1 will
1 that
1 it
1 should
1 be
1 otherwise
1 so
1 be
1 it
1 I
1 have
1 no
1 wife
1 or
1 near
1 relatives
1 to
1 regret
1 my
1 loss
1 -
1 -none
1 my
1 poor
1 boy
1 who
1 will
1 mourn
1 for
1 me
1 as
1 sincerely
1 as
1 I
1 know
1 that
1 you
1 will
1 do
1 In
1 the
1 year
1 that
1 we
1 have
1 been
1 together
1 I
1 have
1 come
1 to
1 look
1 upon
1 you
1 as
1 my
1 son
1 and
1 you
1 will
1 find
1 that
1 I
1 have
1 not
1 forgotten
1 you
1 in
1 my
1 will
1 I
1 have
1 written
1 it
1 in
1 duplicate
1 If
1 you
1 have
1 an
1 opportunity
1 send
1 one
1 of
1 these
1 letters
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 Keep
1 the
1 other
1 yourself
1 and
1 I
1 trust
1 that
1 you
1 will
1 live
1 to
1 carry
1 it
1 to
1 its
1 destination
1 Should
1 it
1 not
1 be
1 so
1 should
1 the
1 worst
1 come
1 to
1 the
1 worst
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 a
1 consolation
1 to
1 you
1 to
1 know
1 that
1 I
1 have
1 not
1 forgotten
1 the
1 little
1 sister
1 of
1 whom
1 you
1 have
1 spoken
1 to
1 me
1 so
1 often
1 and
1 that
1 in
1 case
1 of
1 your
1 death
1 she
1 will
1 be
1 provided
1 for
1 An
1 hour
1 later
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 was
1 in
1 a
1 state
1 of
1 delirium
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 remained
1 all
1 night
1 falling
1 towards
1 morning
1 into
1 a
1 dull
1 coma
1 gradually
1 breathing
1 his
1 last
1 without
1 any
1 return
1 of
1 sensibility
1 at
1 eight
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 Frank
1 was
1 utterly
1 prostrated
1 with
1 grief
1 from
1 which
1 he
1 roused
1 himself
1 to
1 send
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 to
1 ask
1 permission
1 to
1 bury
1 his
1 friend
1 The
1 king
1 sent
1 down
1 to
1 say
1 how
1 grieved
1 he
1 was
1 to
1 hear
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 man
1 s
1 death
1 He
1 had
1 ordered
1 many
1 of
1 his
1 warriors
1 to
1 attend
1 his
1 funeral
1 Frank
1 had
1 a
1 grave
1 dug
1 on
1 a
1 rising
1 spot
1 of
1 ground
1 beyond
1 the
1 marsh
1 In
1 the
1 evening
1 a
1 great
1 number
1 of
1 the
1 warriors
1 gathered
1 round
1 the
1 house
1 and
1 upon
1 the
1 shoulders
1 of
1 four
1 of
1 them
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 was
1 conveyed
1 to
1 his
1 last
1 resting
1 place
1 Frank
1 and
1 the
1 German
1 missionaries
1 following
1 with
1 a
1 great
1 crowd
1 of
1 warriors
1 The
1 missionaries
1 read
1 the
1 service
1 over
1 the
1 grave
1 and
1 Frank
1 returned
1 heart
1 broken
1 to
1 his
1 house
1 with
1 Ostik
1 who
1 also
1 felt
1 terribly
1 the
1 loss
1 of
1 his
1 master
1 Two
1 days
1 later
1 a
1 wooden
1 cross
1 was
1 erected
1 over
1 the
1 grave
1 Upon
1 this
1 Frank
1 carved
1 the
1 name
1 of
1 his
1 friend
1 Hearing
1 a
1 week
1 afterwards
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 was
1 sending
1 down
1 a
1 messenger
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 Frank
1 asked
1 permission
1 to
1 send
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 s
1 letter
1 by
1 him
1 The
1 king
1 sent
1 for
1 him
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 wish
1 any
1 more
1 troubles
1 he
1 said
1 or
1 that
1 letters
1 should
1 be
1 sent
1 to
1 the
1 governor
1 You
1 are
1 my
1 guest
1 hen
1 the
1 troubles
1 are
1 settled
1 I
1 will
1 send
1 you
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 but
1 we
1 have
1 many
1 things
1 to
1 write
1 about
1 and
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 want
1 more
1 subjects
1 for
1 talk
1 Frank
1 showed
1 the
1 letter
1 and
1 read
1 the
1 address
1 and
1 told
1 the
1 king
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 only
1 a
1 letter
1 to
1 the
1 man
1 of
1 business
1 of
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 in
1 England
1 giving
1 directions
1 for
1 the
1 disposal
1 of
1 his
1 property
1 there
1 The
1 king
1 then
1 consented
1 that
1 his
1 messenger
1 should
1 take
1 the
1 letter
1 At
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 December
1 when
1 Frank
1 had
1 been
1 nearly
1 three
1 months
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 Germans
1 said
1 to
1 him
1 The
1 king
1 speaks
1 fairly
1 and
1 seems
1 intent
1 upon
1 his
1 negotiations
1 but
1 he
1 is
1 preparing
1 secretly
1 for
1 war
1 An
1 army
1 is
1 collecting
1 on
1 the
1 Prah
1 I
1 hear
1 that
1 twelve
1 thousand
1 men
1 are
1 ordered
1 to
1 assemble
1 there
1 I
1 have
1 noticed
1 Frank
1 said
1 that
1 there
1 have
1 been
1 fewer
1 men
1 about
1 than
1 usual
1 during
1 the
1 last
1 few
1 days
1 hat
1 will
1 happen
1 to
1 us
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 The
1 missionary
1 shook
1 his
1 head
1 No
1 one
1 can
1 say
1 he
1 said
1 It
1 all
1 depends
1 upon
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 humor
1 I
1 think
1 however
1 that
1 he
1 is
1 more
1 likely
1 to
1 keep
1 us
1 as
1 hostages
1 and
1 to
1 obtain
1 money
1 for
1 us
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 war
1 than
1 to
1 kill
1 us
1 If
1 all
1 goes
1 well
1 with
1 his
1 army
1 we
1 are
1 probably
1 safe
1 but
1 if
1 the
1 news
1 comes
1 of
1 any
1 defeat
1 he
1 may
1 in
1 his
1 rage
1 order
1 us
1 to
1 be
1 executed
1 hat
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 are
1 the
1 chances
1 of
1 defeat
1 Frank
1 asked
1 e
1 know
1 not
1 the
1 missionary
1 said
1 but
1 it
1 seems
1 probable
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 will
1 turn
1 the
1 English
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 coast
1 The
1 Fantis
1 are
1 of
1 no
1 use
1 They
1 were
1 a
1 brave
1 people
1 once
1 and
1 united
1 might
1 have
1 made
1 a
1 successful
1 resistance
1 to
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 but
1 you
1 English
1 have
1 made
1 women
1 of
1 them
1 You
1 have
1 forbidden
1 them
1 to
1 fight
1 among
1 themselves
1 you
1 have
1 discouraged
1 them
1 in
1 any
1 attempts
1 to
1 raise
1 armies
1 you
1 have
1 reduced
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 the
1 chiefs
1 you
1 have
1 tried
1 to
1 turn
1 them
1 into
1 a
1 race
1 of
1 cultivators
1 and
1 traders
1 instead
1 of
1 warriors
1 and
1 you
1 can
1 expect
1 no
1 material
1 aid
1 from
1 them
1 now
1 They
1 will
1 melt
1 away
1 like
1 snow
1 before
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 The
1 king
1 s
1 spies
1 tell
1 him
1 that
1 there
1 are
1 only
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 fifty
1 black
1 troops
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 These
1 are
1 trained
1 and
1 led
1 by
1 Englishmen
1 but
1 after
1 all
1 they
1 are
1 only
1 negroes
1 no
1 braver
1 than
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 hat
1 chance
1 have
1 they
1 of
1 resisting
1 an
1 army
1 nearly
1 a
1 hundred
1 to
1 one
1 stronger
1 than
1 themselves
1 Is
1 the
1 fort
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 strong
1 Frank
1 asked
1 Yes
1 against
1 savages
1 without
1 cannon
1 Besides
1 the
1 guns
1 of
1 the
1 ships
1 of
1 war
1 would
1 cover
1 it
1 ell
1 Frank
1 said
1 if
1 we
1 can
1 hold
1 that
1 they
1 will
1 send
1 out
1 troops
1 from
1 England
1 They
1 may
1 do
1 so
1 the
1 missionary
1 asserted
1 but
1 what
1 could
1 white
1 troops
1 do
1 in
1 the
1 fever
1 haunted
1 forests
1 which
1 extend
1 from
1 Coomassie
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 They
1 will
1 manage
1 somehow
1 Frank
1 replied
1 confidently
1 Besides
1 after
1 all
1 as
1 I
1 hear
1 that
1 the
1 great
1 portion
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 lying
1 beyond
1 this
1 is
1 plain
1 and
1 open
1 country
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 themselves
1 cannot
1 be
1 all
1 accustomed
1 to
1 bush
1 fighting
1 and
1 will
1 suffer
1 from
1 fever
1 in
1 the
1 low
1 swamp
1 land
1 Three
1 days
1 later
1 the
1 king
1 sent
1 for
1 Frank
1 The
1 English
1 are
1 not
1 true
1 he
1 said
1 angrily
1 They
1 promised
1 the
1 people
1 of
1 Elmina
1 that
1 they
1 should
1 be
1 allowed
1 to
1 retain
1 all
1 their
1 customs
1 as
1 under
1 the
1 Dutch
1 They
1 have
1 broken
1 their
1 word
1 They
1 have
1 forbidden
1 the
1 customs
1 The
1 people
1 of
1 Elmina
1 have
1 written
1 to
1 me
1 to
1 ask
1 me
1 to
1 deliver
1 them
1 I
1 am
1 going
1 to
1 do
1 so
1 Frank
1 afterwards
1 learned
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 words
1 were
1 true
1 Colonel
1 Harley
1 the
1 military
1 commandant
1 having
1 with
1 almost
1 incredible
1 fatuity
1 and
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 agreement
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 with
1 the
1 Elminas
1 summoned
1 their
1 king
1 and
1 chiefs
1 to
1 a
1 council
1 and
1 abruptly
1 told
1 them
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 allowed
1 henceforth
1 to
1 celebrate
1 their
1 customs
1 which
1 consisted
1 of
1 firing
1 of
1 guns
1 waving
1 of
1 flags
1 dancing
1 and
1 other
1 harmless
1 rites
1 The
1 chiefs
1 greatly
1 indignant
1 at
1 this
1 breach
1 of
1 the
1 agreement
1 solemnly
1 entered
1 into
1 with
1 them
1 at
1 once
1 on
1 leaving
1 the
1 council
1 wrote
1 to
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 begging
1 him
1 to
1 cross
1 the
1 Prah
1 and
1 attack
1 the
1 English
1 Frank
1 could
1 only
1 say
1 that
1 he
1 knew
1 nothing
1 of
1 what
1 was
1 going
1 on
1 at
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 could
1 only
1 think
1 that
1 his
1 majesty
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 misinformed
1 as
1 the
1 English
1 wished
1 to
1 be
1 friendly
1 with
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 They
1 do
1 not
1 wish
1 it
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 furiously
1 they
1 are
1 liars
1 A
1 buzz
1 of
1 approval
1 sounded
1 among
1 the
1 cabooceers
1 and
1 captains
1 standing
1 round
1 Frank
1 thought
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 about
1 to
1 be
1 ordered
1 to
1 instant
1 execution
1 and
1 grasped
1 a
1 revolver
1 which
1 he
1 held
1 in
1 his
1 pocket
1 resolving
1 to
1 shoot
1 the
1 king
1 first
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 blow
1 out
1 his
1 own
1 brains
1 rather
1 than
1 to
1 be
1 put
1 to
1 the
1 horrible
1 tortures
1 which
1 in
1 Ashanti
1 always
1 precede
1 death
1 Presently
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 suddenly
1 to
1 him
1 My
1 people
1 tell
1 me
1 that
1 you
1 can
1 talk
1 to
1 them
1 in
1 their
1 own
1 tongue
1 I
1 have
1 learnt
1 a
1 little
1 Ashanti
1 Frank
1 said
1 in
1 that
1 language
1 I
1 cannot
1 talk
1 well
1 but
1 I
1 can
1 make
1 myself
1 understood
1 Very
1 well
1 the
1 king
1 said
1 Then
1 I
1 shall
1 send
1 you
1 down
1 with
1 my
1 general
1 You
1 know
1 the
1 ways
1 of
1 English
1 fighting
1 and
1 will
1 tell
1 him
1 what
1 is
1 best
1 to
1 do
1 against
1 them
1 hen
1 the
1 war
1 is
1 over
1 and
1 I
1 have
1 driven
1 the
1 English
1 away
1 I
1 will
1 send
1 you
1 away
1 also
1 You
1 are
1 my
1 guest
1 and
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 wish
1 to
1 harm
1 you
1 Tomorrow
1 you
1 will
1 start
1 Your
1 goods
1 will
1 be
1 of
1 no
1 more
1 use
1 to
1 you
1 I
1 have
1 ordered
1 my
1 treasurer
1 to
1 count
1 the
1 cloth
1 and
1 the
1 powder
1 and
1 the
1 other
1 things
1 which
1 you
1 have
1 and
1 to
1 pay
1 you
1 for
1 them
1 in
1 gold
1 You
1 may
1 go
1 Frank
1 retired
1 vowing
1 in
1 his
1 heart
1 that
1 no
1 information
1 as
1 to
1 the
1 best
1 way
1 of
1 attacking
1 the
1 English
1 should
1 be
1 obtained
1 from
1 him
1 Upon
1 the
1 whole
1 he
1 was
1 much
1 pleased
1 at
1 the
1 order
1 for
1 he
1 thought
1 that
1 some
1 way
1 of
1 making
1 his
1 escape
1 might
1 present
1 itself
1 Such
1 was
1 also
1 the
1 opinion
1 of
1 Ostik
1 when
1 Frank
1 told
1 him
1 what
1 had
1 taken
1 place
1 at
1 the
1 palace
1 An
1 hour
1 later
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 treasurer
1 arrived
1 The
1 whole
1 of
1 the
1 trade
1 goods
1 were
1 appraised
1 at
1 fair
1 prices
1 and
1 even
1 the
1 cases
1 were
1 paid
1 for
1 as
1 the
1 treasurer
1 said
1 that
1 these
1 would
1 be
1 good
1 for
1 keeping
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 state
1 robes
1 Frank
1 only
1 retained
1 his
1 own
1 portmanteau
1 with
1 clothes
1 his
1 bed
1 and
1 rugs
1 and
1 the
1 journals
1 of
1 the
1 expedition
1 a
1 supply
1 of
1 ammunition
1 for
1 his
1 revolver
1 his
1 medicine
1 chest
1 tent
1 and
1 a
1 case
1 with
1 chocolate
1 preserved
1 milk
1 tea
1 biscuits
1 rice
1 and
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 bottles
1 of
1 brandy
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 great
1 beating
1 of
1 drums
1 Four
1 carriers
1 had
1 been
1 told
1 off
1 for
1 Frank
1 s
1 service
1 and
1 these
1 came
1 in
1 took
1 up
1 his
1 baggage
1 and
1 joined
1 the
1 line
1 Frank
1 waited
1 till
1 the
1 general
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 whom
1 he
1 had
1 several
1 times
1 met
1 at
1 the
1 palace
1 came
1 along
1 carried
1 in
1 a
1 hammock
1 with
1 a
1 paraphernalia
1 of
1 attendants
1 bearing
1 chairs
1 umbrellas
1 and
1 flags
1 Frank
1 fell
1 in
1 behind
1 these
1 accompanied
1 by
1 Ostik
1 The
1 whole
1 population
1 of
1 Coomassie
1 turned
1 out
1 and
1 shouted
1 their
1 farewells
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 pause
1 in
1 the
1 marketplace
1 while
1 a
1 hundred
1 victims
1 were
1 sacrificed
1 to
1 the
1 success
1 of
1 the
1 expedition
1 Frank
1 kept
1 in
1 the
1 thick
1 of
1 the
1 warriors
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 avoid
1 witnessing
1 the
1 horrible
1 spectacle
1 As
1 they
1 passed
1 the
1 king
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 the
1 general
1 Bring
1 me
1 back
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 governor
1 I
1 will
1 place
1 it
1 on
1 my
1 drum
1 by
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 that
1 of
1 Macarthy
1 Then
1 the
1 army
1 passed
1 the
1 swamp
1 knee
1 deep
1 in
1 water
1 and
1 started
1 on
1 their
1 way
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 Prah
1 Three
1 miles
1 further
1 they
1 crossed
1 the
1 river
1 Dah
1 at
1 Agogo
1 where
1 the
1 water
1 was
1 up
1 to
1 their
1 necks
1 The
1 road
1 was
1 little
1 more
1 than
1 a
1 track
1 through
1 the
1 forest
1 and
1 many
1 small
1 streams
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 crossed
1 It
1 was
1 well
1 that
1 Frank
1 had
1 not
1 had
1 an
1 attack
1 of
1 fever
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 for
1 they
1 marched
1 without
1 a
1 stop
1 to
1 Fomanse
1 a
1 distance
1 of
1 nearly
1 thirty
1 miles
1 Fomanse
1 was
1 a
1 large
1 town
1 Many
1 of
1 the
1 houses
1 were
1 built
1 in
1 the
1 same
1 style
1 as
1 those
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 and
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 palace
1 was
1 a
1 stone
1 building
1 That
1 night
1 Frank
1 slept
1 in
1 a
1 native
1 house
1 which
1 the
1 general
1 allotted
1 to
1 him
1 close
1 to
1 the
1 palace
1 The
1 army
1 slept
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 they
1 crossed
1 a
1 lofty
1 hill
1 and
1 then
1 descending
1 again
1 kept
1 along
1 through
1 the
1 forest
1 until
1 late
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 they
1 arrived
1 on
1 the
1 Prah
1 This
1 river
1 was
1 about
1 sixty
1 yards
1 wide
1 and
1 here
1 in
1 roughly
1 made
1 huts
1 of
1 boughs
1 were
1 encamped
1 the
1 main
1 army
1 who
1 had
1 preceded
1 them
1 Here
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 pause
1 for
1 a
1 week
1 while
1 large
1 numbers
1 of
1 carriers
1 came
1 down
1 with
1 provisions
1 Then
1 on
1 the
1 2
1 2d
1 of
1 January
1 the
1 army
1 crossed
1 the
1 Prah
1 in
1 great
1 canoes
1 of
1 cottonwood
1 tree
1 which
1 the
1 troops
1 who
1 first
1 arrived
1 had
1 prepared
1 Had
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 army
1 now
1 pushed
1 forward
1 at
1 full
1 speed
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 and
1 Elmina
1 must
1 have
1 fallen
1 into
1 their
1 hands
1 for
1 there
1 were
1 no
1 preparations
1 whatever
1 for
1 their
1 defence
1 The
1 Assims
1 whose
1 territory
1 was
1 first
1 invaded
1 sent
1 down
1 for
1 assistance
1 but
1 Mr
1 Hennessey
1 refused
1 to
1 believe
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 any
1 invasion
1 at
1 all
1 and
1 when
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Akim
1 the
1 most
1 powerful
1 of
1 the
1 Fanti
1 potentates
1 sent
1 down
1 to
1 ask
1 for
1 arms
1 and
1 ammunition
1 Mr
1 Hennessey
1 refused
1 so
1 curtly
1 that
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Akim
1 was
1 grievously
1 offended
1 and
1 sent
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 to
1 say
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 remain
1 neutral
1 in
1 the
1 war
1 About
1 this
1 time
1 Mr
1 Hennessey
1 whose
1 repeated
1 blunders
1 had
1 in
1 no
1 slight
1 degree
1 contributed
1 to
1 the
1 invasion
1 was
1 relieved
1 by
1 Mr
1 Keate
1 who
1 at
1 once
1 wholly
1 alienated
1 the
1 Fantis
1 by
1 telling
1 them
1 that
1 they
1 must
1 defend
1 themselves
1 as
1 the
1 English
1 had
1 nothing
1 more
1 to
1 do
1 with
1 the
1 affair
1 than
1 to
1 defend
1 their
1 forts
1 Considering
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 had
1 taken
1 the
1 natives
1 under
1 their
1 protection
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 war
1 was
1 caused
1 entirely
1 by
1 the
1 taking
1 over
1 of
1 Elmina
1 by
1 the
1 English
1 and
1 by
1 their
1 breach
1 of
1 faith
1 to
1 the
1 natives
1 there
1 this
1 treatment
1 of
1 the
1 Fantis
1 was
1 as
1 unjust
1 as
1 it
1 was
1 impolitic
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 however
1 seemed
1 to
1 be
1 impressed
1 with
1 a
1 spirit
1 of
1 prudence
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 he
1 crossed
1 the
1 river
1 Parties
1 were
1 sent
1 out
1 indeed
1 who
1 attacked
1 and
1 plundered
1 the
1 Assim
1 villages
1 near
1 the
1 Prah
1 but
1 the
1 main
1 body
1 moved
1 forward
1 with
1 the
1 greatest
1 caution
1 sometimes
1 halting
1 for
1 weeks
1 The
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 directed
1 Frank
1 always
1 to
1 pitch
1 his
1 tent
1 next
1 to
1 the
1 hut
1 occupied
1 by
1 himself
1 Four
1 guards
1 were
1 appointed
1 nominally
1 to
1 do
1 him
1 honor
1 but
1 really
1 as
1 Frank
1 saw
1 to
1 prevent
1 him
1 from
1 making
1 his
1 escape
1 These
1 men
1 kept
1 guard
1 two
1 at
1 a
1 time
1 night
1 and
1 day
1 over
1 the
1 tent
1 and
1 if
1 he
1 moved
1 out
1 all
1 followed
1 him
1 He
1 never
1 attempted
1 to
1 leave
1 the
1 camp
1 The
1 forest
1 was
1 extremely
1 dense
1 with
1 thick
1 underwood
1 and
1 innumerable
1 creepers
1 through
1 which
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 almost
1 impossible
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 way
1 The
1 majority
1 of
1 the
1 trees
1 were
1 of
1 only
1 moderate
1 height
1 but
1 above
1 them
1 towered
1 the
1 cotton
1 trees
1 and
1 other
1 giants
1 rising
1 with
1 straight
1 stems
1 to
1 from
1 two
1 hundred
1 and
1 fifty
1 to
1 three
1 hundred
1 feet
1 high
1 Many
1 of
1 the
1 trees
1 had
1 shed
1 their
1 foliage
1 and
1 some
1 of
1 these
1 were
1 completely
1 covered
1 with
1 brilliant
1 flowers
1 of
1 different
1 colors
1 The
1 woods
1 resounded
1 with
1 the
1 cries
1 of
1 various
1 birds
1 but
1 butterflies
1 except
1 in
1 the
1 clearings
1 were
1 scarce
1 The
1 army
1 depended
1 for
1 food
1 partly
1 upon
1 the
1 cultivated
1 patches
1 around
1 the
1 Assim
1 villages
1 partly
1 on
1 supplies
1 brought
1 up
1 from
1 the
1 rear
1 In
1 the
1 forest
1 too
1 they
1 found
1 many
1 edible
1 roots
1 and
1 fruits
1 In
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 efforts
1 to
1 supply
1 them
1 with
1 food
1 Frank
1 saw
1 ere
1 many
1 weeks
1 had
1 passed
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 suffering
1 much
1 from
1 hunger
1 They
1 fell
1 away
1 in
1 flesh
1 Many
1 were
1 shaking
1 with
1 fever
1 and
1 the
1 enthusiasm
1 which
1 was
1 manifest
1 at
1 the
1 passage
1 of
1 the
1 Prah
1 had
1 entirely
1 evaporated
1 The
1 first
1 morning
1 after
1 crossing
1 the
1 river
1 Frank
1 sent
1 Ostik
1 into
1 the
1 hut
1 of
1 the
1 general
1 with
1 a
1 cup
1 of
1 hot
1 chocolate
1 with
1 which
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 expressed
1 himself
1 so
1 much
1 gratified
1 that
1 henceforth
1 Frank
1 sent
1 in
1 a
1 cup
1 every
1 morning
1 having
1 still
1 a
1 large
1 supply
1 of
1 tins
1 of
1 preserved
1 chocolate
1 and
1 milk
1 the
1 very
1 best
1 food
1 which
1 a
1 traveler
1 can
1 take
1 with
1 him
1 In
1 return
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 showed
1 Frank
1 many
1 little
1 kindnesses
1 sending
1 him
1 in
1 birds
1 or
1 animals
1 when
1 any
1 were
1 shot
1 by
1 his
1 men
1 and
1 keeping
1 him
1 as
1 well
1 provided
1 with
1 food
1 as
1 was
1 possible
1 under
1 the
1 circumstances
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 until
1 the
1 8th
1 of
1 April
1 that
1 any
1 absolute
1 hostilities
1 took
1 place
1 Then
1 the
1 Fantis
1 supported
1 by
1 fifty
1 Houssas
1 under
1 Lieutenant
1 Hopkins
1 barred
1 the
1 road
1 outside
1 the
1 village
1 of
1 Dunquah
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 attacked
1 but
1 the
1 Fantis
1 fought
1 bravely
1 having
1 great
1 confidence
1 in
1 the
1 Houssa
1 contingent
1 The
1 battle
1 was
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 fashion
1 neither
1 side
1 attempting
1 any
1 vigorous
1 action
1 but
1 contenting
1 themselves
1 with
1 a
1 heavy
1 fire
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 of
1 a
1 hundred
1 yards
1 All
1 the
1 combatants
1 took
1 shelter
1 behind
1 trees
1 and
1 the
1 consequence
1 was
1 that
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 a
1 great
1 quantity
1 of
1 powder
1 and
1 slugs
1 had
1 been
1 fired
1 away
1 and
1 a
1 very
1 few
1 men
1 hit
1 on
1 either
1 side
1 At
1 nightfall
1 both
1 parties
1 drew
1 off
1 Is
1 that
1 the
1 way
1 your
1 English
1 soldiers
1 fight
1 the
1 general
1 asked
1 Frank
1 that
1 night
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 said
1 vaguely
1 they
1 fire
1 away
1 at
1 each
1 other
1 And
1 then
1 I
1 suppose
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 when
1 one
1 party
1 has
1 exhausted
1 its
1 ammunition
1 it
1 retires
1 Certainly
1 it
1 would
1 retire
1 Frank
1 said
1 It
1 could
1 not
1 resist
1 without
1 ammunition
1 you
1 know
1 Frank
1 carefully
1 abstained
1 from
1 mentioning
1 that
1 one
1 side
1 or
1 the
1 other
1 would
1 advance
1 even
1 before
1 the
1 ammunition
1 of
1 its
1 opponents
1 was
1 expended
1 for
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 wish
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 to
1 adopt
1 tactics
1 which
1 from
1 their
1 greatly
1 superior
1 numbers
1 must
1 at
1 once
1 give
1 them
1 a
1 victory
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 not
1 dissatisfied
1 with
1 the
1 day
1 s
1 work
1 as
1 they
1 considered
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 proved
1 themselves
1 equal
1 to
1 the
1 English
1 troops
1 CHAPTER
1 XVIII
1 THE
1 ATTACK
1 ON
1 ELMINA
1 On
1 the
1 1
1 4th
1 the
1 Fantis
1 took
1 the
1 initiative
1 and
1 attacked
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 The
1 fight
1 was
1 a
1 mere
1 repetition
1 of
1 that
1 of
1 a
1 week
1 before
1 and
1 about
1 midday
1 the
1 Fantis
1 having
1 used
1 up
1 all
1 their
1 ammunition
1 fell
1 back
1 again
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 Now
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 that
1 we
1 have
1 beaten
1 the
1 Fantis
1 we
1 shall
1 march
1 down
1 to
1 Elmina
1 Leaving
1 the
1 main
1 road
1 at
1 Dunquah
1 the
1 army
1 moved
1 slowly
1 through
1 the
1 bush
1 towards
1 Elmina
1 thirty
1 miles
1 distant
1 halting
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 some
1 eight
1 miles
1 from
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 twelve
1 from
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 I
1 am
1 going
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 to
1 look
1 at
1 the
1 English
1 forts
1 My
1 white
1 friend
1 will
1 go
1 with
1 me
1 ith
1 fifty
1 of
1 his
1 warriors
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 left
1 the
1 camp
1 and
1 crossing
1 a
1 stream
1 came
1 down
1 upon
1 the
1 sea
1 coast
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 west
1 of
1 Elmina
1 ith
1 them
1 were
1 several
1 of
1 the
1 Elmina
1 tribe
1 who
1 had
1 come
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 to
1 welcome
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 They
1 approached
1 to
1 within
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 hundred
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 fort
1 which
1 was
1 separated
1 from
1 them
1 by
1 a
1 river
1 The
1 forts
1 on
1 the
1 west
1 coast
1 of
1 Africa
1 not
1 being
1 built
1 to
1 resist
1 artillery
1 are
1 merely
1 barracks
1 surrounded
1 by
1 high
1 walls
1 sufficiently
1 thick
1 to
1 allow
1 men
1 to
1 walk
1 in
1 single
1 file
1 along
1 the
1 top
1 to
1 fire
1 over
1 the
1 parapet
1 The
1 tops
1 of
1 the
1 walls
1 being
1 castellated
1 the
1 buildings
1 have
1 an
1 appearance
1 of
1 much
1 strength
1 The
1 fort
1 of
1 Elmina
1 is
1 of
1 considerable
1 size
1 with
1 a
1 barrack
1 and
1 officers
1 quarters
1 within
1 it
1 One
1 side
1 faces
1 the
1 river
1 and
1 another
1 the
1 sea
1 It
1 is
1 a
1 wonderful
1 fort
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 said
1 much
1 impressed
1 by
1 its
1 appearance
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 replied
1 And
1 there
1 are
1 cannon
1 on
1 the
1 top
1 those
1 great
1 black
1 things
1 you
1 see
1 sticking
1 out
1 Those
1 are
1 guns
1 and
1 each
1 carries
1 balls
1 enough
1 to
1 kill
1 a
1 hundred
1 men
1 with
1 each
1 shot
1 The
1 general
1 looked
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 attentively
1 But
1 you
1 have
1 castles
1 in
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 s
1 country
1 how
1 do
1 you
1 take
1 them
1 e
1 bring
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 cannon
1 throwing
1 balls
1 of
1 iron
1 as
1 big
1 as
1 my
1 head
1 Frank
1 answered
1 and
1 so
1 knock
1 a
1 great
1 hole
1 in
1 the
1 wall
1 and
1 then
1 rush
1 in
1 But
1 if
1 there
1 are
1 no
1 cannon
1 the
1 general
1 urged
1 e
1 never
1 attack
1 a
1 castle
1 without
1 cannon
1 Frank
1 said
1 But
1 if
1 we
1 had
1 no
1 cannon
1 we
1 might
1 try
1 to
1 starve
1 the
1 people
1 out
1 but
1 you
1 cannot
1 do
1 that
1 here
1 because
1 they
1 would
1 land
1 food
1 from
1 the
1 sea
1 The
1 general
1 looked
1 puzzled
1 hy
1 do
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 come
1 here
1 They
1 come
1 to
1 trade
1 he
1 said
1 presently
1 Yes
1 they
1 come
1 to
1 trade
1 Frank
1 replied
1 And
1 they
1 have
1 no
1 other
1 reason
1 No
1 Frank
1 said
1 They
1 do
1 not
1 want
1 to
1 take
1 land
1 because
1 the
1 white
1 man
1 cannot
1 work
1 in
1 so
1 hot
1 a
1 climate
1 Then
1 if
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 trade
1 he
1 would
1 go
1 away
1 the
1 general
1 asked
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 agreed
1 if
1 he
1 could
1 do
1 no
1 trade
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 no
1 use
1 remaining
1 here
1 e
1 will
1 let
1 him
1 do
1 no
1 trade
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 brightening
1 up
1 If
1 we
1 cannot
1 take
1 the
1 forts
1 we
1 will
1 surround
1 them
1 closely
1 and
1 no
1 trade
1 can
1 come
1 in
1 and
1 out
1 Then
1 the
1 white
1 man
1 will
1 have
1 to
1 go
1 away
1 As
1 to
1 the
1 Fantis
1 we
1 will
1 destroy
1 them
1 and
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 will
1 have
1 no
1 one
1 to
1 fight
1 for
1 them
1 But
1 there
1 are
1 white
1 troops
1 Frank
1 said
1 hite
1 soldiers
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 asked
1 surprised
1 I
1 thought
1 it
1 was
1 only
1 black
1 soldiers
1 that
1 fought
1 for
1 the
1 whites
1 The
1 whites
1 are
1 few
1 they
1 are
1 traders
1 The
1 English
1 are
1 many
1 Frank
1 said
1 earnestly
1 For
1 every
1 man
1 that
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 could
1 send
1 to
1 fight
1 England
1 could
1 send
1 ten
1 There
1 are
1 white
1 soldiers
1 numbers
1 of
1 them
1 but
1 they
1 are
1 not
1 sent
1 here
1 They
1 are
1 kept
1 at
1 home
1 to
1 fight
1 other
1 white
1 nations
1 the
1 French
1 and
1 the
1 Dutch
1 and
1 the
1 Danes
1 and
1 many
1 others
1 just
1 as
1 the
1 kings
1 of
1 Africa
1 fight
1 against
1 each
1 other
1 They
1 are
1 not
1 sent
1 here
1 because
1 the
1 climate
1 kills
1 the
1 whites
1 so
1 to
1 guard
1 the
1 white
1 traders
1 here
1 we
1 hire
1 black
1 soldiers
1 but
1 when
1 it
1 is
1 known
1 in
1 England
1 that
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 is
1 fighting
1 against
1 our
1 forts
1 they
1 will
1 send
1 white
1 troops
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 was
1 thoughtful
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 If
1 they
1 come
1 he
1 said
1 at
1 length
1 the
1 fevers
1 will
1 kill
1 them
1 The
1 white
1 man
1 cannot
1 live
1 in
1 the
1 swamps
1 Your
1 friend
1 the
1 white
1 guest
1 of
1 the
1 king
1 died
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 asserted
1 but
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 nearly
1 a
1 year
1 in
1 the
1 country
1 before
1 he
1 died
1 Three
1 weeks
1 will
1 be
1 enough
1 for
1 an
1 English
1 army
1 to
1 march
1 from
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 A
1 few
1 might
1 die
1 but
1 most
1 of
1 them
1 would
1 get
1 there
1 Coomassie
1 the
1 general
1 exclaimed
1 in
1 surprise
1 The
1 white
1 men
1 would
1 be
1 mad
1 to
1 think
1 of
1 marching
1 against
1 the
1 city
1 of
1 the
1 great
1 king
1 e
1 should
1 make
1 great
1 fetish
1 and
1 they
1 would
1 all
1 die
1 when
1 they
1 had
1 crossed
1 the
1 river
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 think
1 General
1 Frank
1 said
1 dryly
1 that
1 the
1 fetishes
1 of
1 the
1 black
1 man
1 have
1 any
1 effect
1 upon
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 A
1 fetish
1 has
1 power
1 when
1 it
1 is
1 believed
1 in
1 A
1 man
1 who
1 knows
1 that
1 his
1 enemy
1 has
1 made
1 a
1 fetish
1 against
1 him
1 is
1 afraid
1 His
1 blood
1 becomes
1 like
1 water

1 he
1 dies
1 But
1 the
1 whites
1 do
1 not
1 believe
1 in
1 fetishes
1 They
1 laugh
1 at
1 them
1 and
1 then
1 the
1 fetishes
1 cannot
1 hurt
1 them
1 The
1 general
1 said
1 no
1 more
1 but
1 turned
1 thoughtfully
1 and
1 retired
1 to
1 his
1 camp
1 It
1 was
1 tantalizing
1 to
1 Frank
1 to
1 see
1 the
1 Union
1 Jack
1 waving
1 within
1 sight
1 and
1 to
1 know
1 that
1 friends
1 were
1 so
1 near
1 and
1 yet
1 to
1 be
1 unable
1 to
1 stretch
1 out
1 his
1 hand
1 to
1 them
1 He
1 was
1 now
1 dressed
1 in
1 all
1 respects
1 like
1 a
1 native
1 the
1 king
1 having
1 soon
1 after
1 his
1 arrival
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 sent
1 a
1 present
1 of
1 clothes
1 such
1 as
1 were
1 worn
1 by
1 his
1 nobles
1 saying
1 that
1 the
1 people
1 would
1 not
1 notice
1 them
1 so
1 much
1 if
1 they
1 were
1 dressed
1 like
1 themselves
1 Consequently
1 had
1 the
1 party
1 been
1 seen
1 from
1 the
1 castle
1 walls
1 the
1 appearance
1 of
1 an
1 Englishman
1 among
1 them
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 unobserved
1 Three
1 days
1 later
1 the
1 general
1 with
1 a
1 similar
1 party
1 crossed
1 the
1 Sweet
1 river
1 at
1 night
1 and
1 proceeded
1 along
1 the
1 sea
1 coast
1 to
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 hundred
1 yards
1 of
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 Castle
1 whose
1 appearance
1 pleased
1 him
1 no
1 more
1 than
1 that
1 of
1 Elmina
1 had
1 done
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 now
1 better
1 supplied
1 with
1 food
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 depend
1 upon
1 the
1 Elmina
1 tribes
1 who
1 cultivated
1 a
1 considerable
1 extent
1 of
1 ground
1 and
1 to
1 add
1 to
1 the
1 stock
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 soldiers
1 were
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 to
1 aid
1 in
1 planting
1 a
1 larger
1 extent
1 of
1 ground
1 than
1 usual
1 a
1 proof
1 in
1 Frank
1 s
1 mind
1 that
1 the
1 general
1 contemplated
1 making
1 a
1 long
1 stay
1 and
1 blockading
1 Elmina
1 and
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 into
1 surrender
1 if
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 carry
1 them
1 by

1 The
1 natives
1 of
1 Africa
1 are
1 capable
1 of
1 great
1 exertion
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 but
1 their
1 habitual
1 attitude
1 is
1 that
1 of
1 extreme
1 laziness
1 One
1 week
1 s
1 work
1 in

1 to

1 the

1 with
1 melons

1 as
1 the
1 king
1 ordered
1 were
1 that
1 time
1 years
1 distant
1 Frank
1 was
1 often
1 filled
1 with
1 disgust
1 at
1 seeing
1 these
1 noble
1 savages
1 lying
1 indolently
1 from
1 morn
1 till
1 night
1 while
1 their
1 wives
1 went
1 miles
1 in
1 the
1 forest
1 searching
1 for
1 pineapples
1 and
1 fruits
1 bent
1 down
1 and
1 prematurely
1 aged
1 by
1 toil
1 and
1 hardship
1 Many
1 of
1 the
1 young
1 girls
1 among
1 the
1 negroes
1 are
1 pretty
1 with
1 their
1 soft
1 eyes
1 and
1 skin
1 like
1 velvet
1 their
1 merry
1 laugh
1 and
1 graceful
1 figures
1 But
1 in
1 a
1 very
1 few
1 years
1 all
1 this
1 disappears
1 and
1 by
1 middle
1 age
1 they
1 are
1 bent
1 and
1 wrinkled
1 and
1 old
1 All
1 loads
1 are
1 carried
1 by
1 women
1 with
1 the
1 exception
1 only
1 of
1 hammocks
1 which
1 are
1 exclusively
1 carried
1 by
1 men
1 Thus
1 then
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 settled
1 down
1 to
1 what
1 appeared
1 to
1 Frank
1 to
1 be
1 an
1 interminable
1 business
1 and
1 what
1 rendered
1 it
1 more
1 tantalizing
1 was
1 that
1 the
1 morning
1 and
1 evening
1 guns
1 at
1 the
1 English
1 forts
1 could
1 be
1 plainly
1 heard
1 It
1 was
1 on
1 the
1 7th
1 of
1 June
1 that
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 reconnoitered
1 Elmina
1 and
1 the
1 news
1 came
1 next
1 day
1 that
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 ten
1 white
1 men
1 in
1 red
1 coats
1 had
1 landed
1 from
1 a
1 ship
1 which
1 had
1 arrived
1 that
1 morning
1 off
1 the
1 coast
1 Frank
1 judged
1 from
1 the
1 description
1 that
1 these
1 must
1 be
1 marines
1 from
1 a
1 ship
1 of
1 war
1 In
1 this
1 he
1 was
1 correct
1 as
1 they
1 consisted
1 of
1 marines
1 and
1 marine
1 artillerymen
1 under
1 Lieutenant
1 Colonel
1 Festing
1 who
1 had
1 just
1 arrived
1 from
1 England
1 Three
1 days
1 later
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 with
1 a
1 portion
1 of
1 his
1 force
1 moved
1 down
1 close
1 to
1 Elmina
1 Frank
1 was
1 told
1 to
1 accompany
1 them
1 Shortly
1 afterwards
1 the
1 news
1 came
1 that
1 the
1 Elminas
1 were
1 all
1 ordered
1 to
1 lay
1 down
1 their
1 arms
1 They
1 replied
1 by
1 going
1 over
1 in
1 a
1 body
1 to
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 determined
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 attack
1 the
1 town
1 but
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 advancing
1 the
1 guns
1 of
1 the
1 ships
1 of
1 war
1 opened
1 fire
1 upon
1 the
1 native
1 town
1 of
1 Elmina
1 which
1 lay
1 to
1 the
1 west
1 of
1 the
1 European
1 quarter
1 The
1 sound
1 of
1 such
1 heavy
1 cannon
1 differing
1 widely
1 from
1 anything
1 they
1 had
1 ever
1 heard
1 before
1 caused
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 to
1 pause
1 in
1 astonishment
1 Then
1 came
1 the
1 howl
1 of
1 the
1 shells
1 which
1 exploded
1 in
1 rapid
1 succession
1 in
1 the
1 village
1 from
1 which
1 flames
1 began
1 immediately
1 to
1 rise
1 After
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 hesitation
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 and
1 Elminas
1 again
1 advanced
1 The
1 general
1 who
1 was
1 carried
1 in
1 a
1 chair
1 upon
1 the
1 shoulders
1 of
1 four
1 men
1 took
1 his
1 post
1 on
1 rising
1 ground
1 near
1 the
1 burning
1 village
1 There
1 he
1 said
1 the
1 English
1 soldiers
1 are
1 coming
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 fort
1 Now
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 The
1 little
1 body
1 of
1 marines
1 and
1 the
1 blue
1 jackets
1 of
1 the
1 Barraconta
1 deployed
1 in
1 line
1 as
1 they
1 sallied
1 from
1 the
1 fort
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 opened
1 fire
1 upon
1 them
1 but
1 they
1 were
1 out
1 of
1 range
1 of
1 the
1 slugs
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 the
1 line
1 was
1 formed
1 the
1 English
1 opened
1 fire
1 and
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 perfectly
1 astonished
1 at
1 the
1 incessant
1 rattle
1 of
1 musketry
1 from
1 so
1 small
1 a
1 body
1 of
1 men
1 But
1 it
1 was
1 not
1 all
1 noise
1 for
1 the
1 Snider
1 bullets
1 swept
1 among
1 the
1 crowded
1 body
1 of
1 blacks
1 mowing
1 them
1 down
1 in
1 considerable
1 numbers
1 In
1 two
1 minutes
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 turned
1 and
1 ran
1 The
1 general
1 s
1 bearers
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 his
1 shouts
1 hurried
1 away
1 with
1 him
1 with
1 the
1 others
1 and
1 Frank
1 would
1 have
1 taken
1 this
1 opportunity
1 to
1 escape
1 had
1 not
1 two
1 of
1 his
1 guards
1 seized
1 him
1 by
1 the
1 arms
1 and
1 hauled
1 him
1 along
1 while
1 the
1 other
1 two
1 kept
1 close
1 behind
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 they
1 had
1 passed
1 over
1 the
1 crest
1 of
1 the
1 rise
1 and
1 the
1 British
1 fire
1 had
1 ceased
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 leaped
1 from
1 his
1 chair
1 and
1 threw
1 himself
1 among
1 his
1 flying
1 troops
1 striking
1 them
1 right
1 and
1 left
1 with
1 his
1 staff
1 and
1 hurling
1 imprecations
1 upon
1 them
1 If
1 you
1 do
1 not
1 stop
1 and
1 return
1 against
1 the
1 whites
1 he
1 said
1 I
1 will
1 send
1 every
1 one
1 of
1 you
1 back
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 and
1 there
1 you
1 will
1 be
1 put
1 to
1 death
1 as
1 cowards
1 The
1 threat
1 sufficed
1 The
1 fugitives
1 rallied
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 were
1 ready
1 to
1 march
1 back
1 again
1 It
1 was
1 the
1 surprise
1 created
1 by
1 the
1 wonderful
1 sustained
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 breech
1 loaders
1 rather
1 than
1 the
1 actual
1 loss
1 they
1 inflicted
1 which
1 caused
1 the
1 panic
1 In
1 the
1 meantime
1 believing
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 retired
1 the
1 naval
1 contingent
1 went
1 back
1 to
1 their
1 boats
1 when
1 the
1 Dutch
1 vice
1 consul
1 having
1 ascended
1 a
1 hill
1 to
1 look
1 round
1 saw
1 that
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 had
1 made
1 a
1 detour
1 with
1 his
1 troops
1 and
1 was
1 marching
1 against
1 the
1 town
1 from
1 the
1 east
1 where
1 he
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 exposed
1 to
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 fort
1 He
1 instantly
1 ran
1 back
1 with
1 the
1 news
1 The
1 marines
1 and
1 the
1 thirty
1 est
1 Indian
1 soldiers
1 in
1 the
1 fort
1 at
1 once
1 marched
1 out
1 and
1 met
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 just
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 entering
1 the
1 town
1 The
1 fight
1 was
1 a
1 severe
1 one
1 and
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 neither
1 side
1 appeared
1 to
1 have
1 the
1 advantage
1 and
1 Frank
1 who
1 under
1 the
1 care
1 of
1 his
1 guards
1 was
1 a
1 few
1 hundred
1 yards
1 in
1 the
1 rear
1 was
1 filled
1 with
1 dismay
1 at
1 observing
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 heavy
1 loss
1 they
1 were
1 suffering
1 were
1 gaining
1 ground
1 and
1 pressing
1 forward
1 bravely
1 Suddenly
1 he
1 gave
1 a
1 shout
1 of
1 joy
1 for
1 on
1 a
1 rise
1 on
1 the
1 flank
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 appeared
1 the
1 sailors
1 of
1 the
1 Barraconta
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 led
1 round
1 from
1 the
1 boats
1 by
1 Lieutenant
1 ells
1 R
1 N
1 who
1 was
1 in
1 command
1 The
1 instant
1 these
1 took
1 up
1 their
1 position
1 they
1 opened
1 a
1 heavy
1 fire
1 upon
1 the
1 flank
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 who
1 dismayed
1 by
1 this
1 attack
1 by
1 fresh
1 foes
1 lost
1 heart
1 and
1 at
1 once
1 fled
1 hastily
1 In
1 the
1 two
1 engagements
1 they
1 had
1 lost
1 nearly
1 four
1 hundred
1 men
1 Frank
1 of
1 course
1 retired
1 with
1 the
1 beaten
1 Ashantis
1 and
1 that
1 evening
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 told
1 him
1 that
1 the
1 arms
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 were
1 too
1 good
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 not
1 attack
1 them
1 again
1 in
1 the
1 open
1 Their
1 guns
1 shoot
1 farther
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 quicker
1 than
1 ours
1 he
1 said
1 Our
1 slugs
1 are
1 no
1 use
1 against
1 the
1 heavy
1 bullets
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 but
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 where
1 you
1 cannot
1 see
1 twenty
1 feet
1 among
1 the
1 trees
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 different
1 If
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 attack
1 them
1 they
1 must
1 attack
1 me
1 or
1 their
1 trade
1 will
1 be
1 starved
1 out
1 hen
1 they
1 come
1 into
1 the
1 woods
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 that
1 we
1 shall
1 eat
1 them
1 up
1 Several
1 weeks
1 now
1 passed
1 quietly
1 There
1 was
1 news
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 great
1 sickness
1 among
1 the
1 white
1 soldiers
1 and
1 indeed
1 with
1 scarce
1 an
1 exception
1 the
1 marines
1 first
1 sent
1 out
1 were
1 invalided
1 home
1 but

1 and
1 fifty
1 more
1 arrived
1 to
1 take
1 their
1 place
1 Some
1 detachments
1 of
1 the
1 2d
1 est
1 Indian
1 regiment
1 came
1 down
1 to
1 join
1 their
1 comrades
1 from
1 Sierra
1 Leone
1 and
1 the
1 situation
1 remained
1 unchanged
1 One
1 night
1 towards
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 August
1 a
1 messenger
1 arrived
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 an
1 immediate
1 stir
1 Now
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 you
1 are
1 going
1 to
1 see
1 us
1 fight
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 Some
1 of
1 the
1 big
1 ships
1 have
1 gone
1 to
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 Prah
1 and
1 we
1 believe
1 that
1 they
1 are
1 going
1 to
1 land
1 in
1 boats
1 You
1 will
1 see
1 The
1 Elmina
1 tribes
1 are
1 going
1 to
1 attack
1 but
1 I
1 shall
1 take
1 some
1 of
1 my
1 men
1 to
1 help
1 Taking
1 fifty
1 picked
1 warriors
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 started
1 at
1 once
1 They
1 marched
1 all
1 night
1 towards
1 the
1 west
1 and
1 at
1 daybreak
1 joined
1 the
1 Elminas
1 These
1 took
1 post
1 in
1 the
1 brushwood
1 lining
1 the
1 river
1 The
1 general
1 with
1 a
1 dozen
1 men
1 taking
1 Frank
1 went
1 down
1 near
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 to
1 reconnoiter
1 The
1 ships
1 lay
1 more
1 than
1 a
1 mile
1 off
1 the
1 shore
1 Presently
1 a
1 half
1 dozen
1 boats
1 were
1 lowered
1 filled
1 with
1 men
1 and
1 taken
1 in
1 tow
1 by
1 a
1 steam
1 launch
1 It
1 was
1 seen
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 making
1 for
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 Now
1 let
1 us
1 go
1 back
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 said
1 You
1 will
1 see
1 what
1 we
1 shall
1 do
1 Frank
1 felt
1 full
1 of
1 excitement
1 He
1 saw
1 the
1 English
1 running
1 into
1 an
1 ambuscade
1 and
1 he
1 determined
1 even
1 if
1 it
1 should
1 cost
1 him
1 his
1 life
1 to
1 warn
1 them
1 Presently
1 they
1 heard
1 the
1 sharp
1 puffs
1 of
1 the
1 steam
1 launch
1 The
1 boats
1 were
1 within
1 three
1 hundred
1 yards
1 Frank
1 stepped
1 forward
1 and
1 was
1 about
1 to
1 give
1 a
1 warning
1 shout
1 when
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 s
1 eye
1 fell
1 upon
1 him
1 The
1 expression
1 of
1 his
1 face
1 revealed
1 his
1 intention
1 to
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 who
1 in
1 an
1 instant
1 sprang
1 upon
1 him
1 and
1 hurled
1 him
1 to
1 the
1 ground
1 Instantly
1 a
1 dozen
1 hands
1 seized
1 him
1 and
1 in
1 obedience
1 to
1 the
1 general
1 s
1 order
1 fastened
1 a
1 bandage
1 tightly
1 across
1 his
1 mouth
1 and
1 then
1 bound
1 him
1 standing
1 against
1 a
1 tree
1 where
1 he
1 could
1 observe
1 what
1 was
1 going
1 on
1 The
1 incident
1 had
1 occupied
1 but
1 a
1 minute
1 and
1 Frank
1 heard
1 the
1 pant
1 of
1 the
1 steam
1 launch
1 coming
1 nearer
1 and
1 nearer
1 Presently
1 through
1 the
1 bushes
1 he
1 caught
1 a
1 glimpse
1 of
1 it
1 and
1 then
1 as
1 it
1 came
1 along
1 of
1 the
1 boats
1 towing
1 behind
1 The
1 Elminas
1 and
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 lying
1 upon
1 the
1 ground
1 with
1 their
1 guns
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 them
1 The
1 boats
1 were
1 but
1 fifteen
1 yards
1 from
1 the
1 bank
1 hen
1 they
1 were
1 abreast
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 shouted
1 the
1 word
1 of
1 command
1 and
1 a
1 stream
1 of
1 fire
1 shot
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 bushes
1 In
1 the
1 boats
1 all
1 was
1 confusion
1 Several
1 were
1 killed
1 and
1 many
1 wounded
1 by
1 the
1 deadly
1 volley
1 among
1 the
1 latter
1 Commodore
1 Commerell
1 himself
1 and
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 of
1 his
1 officers
1 The
1 launch
1 now
1 attempted
1 to
1 turn
1 round
1 and
1 the
1 marines
1 in
1 the
1 boats
1 opened
1 fire
1 upon
1 their
1 invisible
1 foes
1 who
1 replied
1 steadily
1 In
1 five
1 minutes
1 from
1 the
1 first
1 shot
1 being
1 fired
1 all
1 was
1 over
1 the
1 launch
1 was
1 steaming
1 down
1 with
1 the
1 boats
1 in
1 tow
1 towards
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 the
1 exulting
1 shouts
1 of
1 the
1 natives
1 ringing
1 in
1 the
1 ears
1 of
1 those
1 on
1 board
1 The
1 position
1 of
1 Frank
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 a
1 pleasant
1 one
1 while
1 the
1 fight
1 had
1 lasted
1 for
1 the
1 English
1 rifle
1 bullets
1 sang
1 close
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 quick
1 succession
1 one
1 striking
1 the
1 tree
1 only
1 a
1 few
1 inches
1 above
1 his
1 head
1 He
1 was
1 doubtful
1 too
1 as
1 to
1 what
1 his
1 fate
1 would
1 be
1 at
1 the
1 termination
1 of
1 the
1 fight
1 Fortunately
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 was
1 in
1 the
1 highest
1 spirits
1 at
1 his
1 victory
1 He
1 ordered
1 Frank
1 to
1 be
1 at
1 once
1 unbound
1 There
1 you
1 see
1 he
1 said
1 the
1 whites
1 are
1 of
1 no
1 use
1 They
1 cannot
1 fight
1 They
1 run
1 with
1 their
1 eyes
1 shut
1 into
1 danger
1 So
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 if
1 they
1 attack
1 us
1 on
1 the
1 land
1 You
1 were
1 foolish
1 hy
1 did
1 you
1 wish
1 to
1 call
1 out
1 Are
1 you
1 not
1 well
1 treated
1 Are
1 you
1 not
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 guest
1 Am
1 I
1 not
1 your
1 friend
1 I
1 am
1 well
1 treated
1 and
1 you
1 are
1 my
1 friend
1 Frank
1 said
1 but
1 the
1 English
1 are
1 my
1 countrymen
1 I
1 am
1 sure
1 that
1 were
1 you
1 in
1 the
1 hands
1 of
1 the
1 English
1 and
1 you
1 saw
1 a
1 party
1 of
1 your
1 countrymen
1 marching
1 into
1 danger
1 you
1 would
1 call
1 out
1 and
1 warn
1 them
1 even
1 if
1 you
1 knew
1 that
1 you
1 would
1 be
1 killed
1 for
1 doing
1 so
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 know
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 said
1 candidly
1 I
1 cannot
1 say
1 what
1 I
1 should
1 do
1 but
1 you
1 were
1 brave
1 to
1 run
1 the
1 risk
1 and
1 I
1 m
1 not
1 angry
1 with
1 you
1 Only
1 in
1 future
1 when
1 we
1 go
1 to
1 attack
1 the
1 English
1 I
1 must
1 gag
1 you
1 to
1 prevent
1 your
1 giving
1 the
1 alarm
1 That
1 is
1 fair
1 enough
1 Frank
1 said
1 pleased
1 that
1 the
1 matter
1 had
1 passed
1 off
1 so
1 well
1 only
1 another
1 time
1 do
1 not
1 stick
1 me
1 upright
1 against
1 a
1 tree
1 where
1 I
1 may
1 be
1 killed
1 by
1 English
1 bullets
1 I
1 had
1 a
1 narrow
1 escape
1 of
1 it
1 this
1 time
1 you
1 see
1 and
1 he
1 pointed
1 to
1 the
1 hole
1 in
1 the
1 trunk
1 of
1 the
1 tree
1 I
1 am
1 sorry
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 said
1 with
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 real
1 concern
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 think
1 of
1 your
1 being
1 in
1 danger
1 I
1 only
1 wished
1 you
1 to
1 have
1 a
1 good
1 sight
1 of
1 the
1 battle
1 next
1 time
1 I
1 will
1 put
1 you
1 in
1 a
1 safer
1 place
1 They
1 then
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 a
1 distant
1 cannonade
1 was
1 heard
1 and
1 at
1 nightfall
1 the
1 news
1 came
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 fleet
1 had
1 bombarded
1 and
1 burnt
1 several
1 Elmina
1 villages
1 at
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 Prah
1 Ah
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 the
1 English
1 have
1 great
1 ships
1 and
1 great
1 guns
1 They
1 can
1 fight
1 on
1 the
1 seaside
1 and
1 round
1 their
1 forts
1 but
1 they
1 cannot
1 drag
1 their
1 guns
1 through
1 the
1 forests
1 and
1 swamps
1 No
1 Frank
1 agreed
1 It
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 possible
1 to
1 drag
1 heavy
1 artillery
1 No
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 repeated
1 exultingly
1 hen
1 they
1 are
1 beyond
1 the
1 shelter
1 of
1 their
1 ships
1 they
1 are
1 no
1 good
1 whatever
1 e
1 will
1 kill
1 them
1 all
1 The
1 wet
1 season
1 had
1 now
1 set
1 in
1 in
1 earnest
1 and
1 the
1 suffering
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 very
1 great
1 Accustomed
1 as
1 many
1 of
1 them
1 were
1 to
1 high
1 lying
1 lands
1 free
1 of
1 trees
1 the
1 miasma
1 from
1 the
1 swamps
1 was
1 well
1 nigh
1 as
1 fatal
1 to
1 them
1 as
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 to
1 Europeans
1 Thousands
1 died
1 and
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 rest
1 were
1 worn
1 by
1 fever
1 to
1 mere
1 shadows
1 Do
1 you
1 think
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 one
1 day
1 that
1 it
1 is
1 possible
1 to
1 blow
1 up
1 a
1 whole
1 town
1 with
1 powder
1 It
1 would
1 be
1 possible
1 if
1 there
1 were
1 powder
1 enough
1 Frank
1 said
1 wondering
1 what
1 could
1 be
1 the
1 motive
1 of
1 the
1 question
1 They
1 say
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 have
1 put
1 powder
1 in
1 holes
1 all
1 over
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 and
1 my
1 people
1 are
1 afraid
1 to
1 go
1 The
1 guns
1 of
1 the
1 fort
1 could
1 not
1 shoot
1 over
1 the
1 whole
1 town
1 and
1 there
1 are
1 few
1 white
1 soldiers
1 there
1 but
1 my
1 men
1 fear
1 to
1 be
1 blown
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 air
1 Yes
1 Frank
1 said
1 gravely
1 The
1 danger
1 might
1 be
1 great
1 It
1 is
1 better
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 should
1 keep
1 away
1 from
1 the
1 town
1 But
1 if
1 the
1 fever
1 goes
1 on
1 as
1 at
1 present
1 the
1 army
1 will
1 melt
1 away
1 Ten
1 thousand
1 more
1 men
1 are
1 coming
1 down
1 when
1 the
1 rains
1 are
1 over
1 The
1 king
1 says
1 that
1 something
1 must
1 be
1 done
1 There
1 is
1 talk
1 in
1 the
1 English
1 forts
1 that
1 more
1 white
1 troops
1 are
1 coming
1 out
1 from
1 England
1 If
1 this
1 is
1 so
1 I
1 shall
1 not
1 attack
1 the
1 towns
1 but
1 shall
1 wait
1 for
1 them
1 to
1 come
1 into
1 the
1 woods
1 for
1 me
1 Then
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 Do
1 they
1 say
1 there
1 are
1 many
1 troops
1 Frank
1 asked
1 anxiously
1 No
1 they
1 say
1 only
1 some
1 white
1 officers
1 but
1 this
1 is
1 foolishness
1 hat
1 could
1 white
1 officers
1 do
1 without
1 soldiers
1 As
1 for
1 the
1 Fantis
1 they
1 are
1 cowards
1 they
1 are
1 only
1 good
1 to
1 carry
1 burdens
1 and
1 to
1 hoe
1 the
1 ground
1 They
1 are
1 women
1 and
1 not
1 men
1 During
1 this
1 time
1 when
1 the
1 damp
1 rose
1 so
1 thick
1 and
1 steaming
1 that
1 everything
1 was
1 saturated
1 with
1 it
1 Frank
1 had
1 a
1 very
1 sharp
1 attack
1 of
1 fever
1 and
1 was
1 for
1 a
1 fortnight
1 just
1 after
1 the
1 repulse
1 of
1 the
1 attack
1 on
1 Elmina
1 completely
1 prostrated
1 Such
1 an
1 attack
1 would
1 at
1 his
1 first
1 landing
1 have
1 carried
1 him
1 off
1 but
1 he
1 was
1 now
1 getting
1 acclimatized
1 and
1 his
1 supply
1 of
1 quinine
1 was
1 abundant
1 ith
1 its
1 aid
1 he
1 saved
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 lives
1 among
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 and
1 many
1 little
1 presents
1 in
1 the
1 way
1 of
1 fruit
1 and
1 birds
1 did
1 he
1 receive
1 from
1 his
1 patients
1 I
1 wish
1 I
1 could
1 let
1 you
1 go
1 the
1 general
1 said
1 to
1 him
1 one
1 day
1 You
1 are
1 a
1 good
1 white
1 man
1 and
1 my
1 soldiers
1 love
1 you
1 for
1 the
1 pains
1 you
1 take
1 going
1 amongst
1 them
1 when
1 they
1 are
1 sick
1 and
1 giving
1 them
1 the
1 medicine
1 of
1 the
1 whites
1 But
1 I
1 dare
1 not
1 do
1 it
1 As
1 you
1 know
1 when
1 the
1 king
1 is
1 wroth
1 the
1 greatest
1 tremble
1 and
1 I
1 dare
1 not
1 tell
1 the
1 king
1 that
1 I
1 have
1 let
1 you
1 go
1 ere
1 it
1 otherwise
1 I
1 would
1 gladly
1 do
1 so
1 I
1 have
1 written
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 telling
1 him
1 that
1 you
1 have
1 saved
1 the
1 lives
1 of
1 many
1 here
1 It
1 may
1 be
1 that
1 he
1 will
1 order
1 you
1 to
1 be
1 released
1 CHAPTER
1 XIX
1 THE
1 TIDE
1 TURNED
1 From
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 points
1 in
1 the
1 forest
1 held
1 by
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 the
1 sea
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 and
1 on
1 the
1 morning
1 of
1 the
1 2d
1 of
1 October
1 a
1 steamer
1 which
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 there
1 on
1 the
1 previous
1 evening
1 was
1 perceived
1 lying
1 off
1 the
1 town
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 soon
1 informed
1 by
1 spies
1 in
1 Elmina
1 and
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 that
1 the
1 ship
1 had
1 brought
1 an
1 English
1 general
1 with
1 about
1 thirty
1 officers
1 The
1 news
1 that
1 thirty
1 men
1 had
1 come
1 out
1 to
1 help
1 to
1 drive
1 back
1 twenty
1 thousand
1 was
1 received
1 with
1 derision
1 by
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 They
1 will
1 do
1 more
1 than
1 you
1 think
1 Frank
1 said
1 when
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 was
1 scoffing
1 over
1 the
1 new
1 arrival
1 You
1 will
1 see
1 a
1 change
1 in
1 the
1 tactics
1 of
1 the
1 whites
1 Hitherto
1 they
1 have
1 done
1 nothing
1 They
1 have
1 simply
1 waited
1 Now
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 they
1 will
1 begin
1 to
1 move
1 The
1 officers
1 will
1 drill
1 the

1 The

1 that

1 Ten
1 days
1 passed
1 after

1 landing
1 It
1 was

1 camp
1 that

1 The
1 Ashantis
1 however
1 had
1 no
1 fear
1 whatever
1 on
1 this
1 score
1 The
1 twenty
1 thousand
1 natives
1 who
1 occupied
1 the

1 had

1 where

1 The
1 kings
1 had

1 or

1 and

1 with
1 the

1 in

1 The
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 was
1 furious
1 and
1 poured
1 out
1 threats
1 against
1 his
1 spies
1 in

1 Coast
1 for
1 not

1 that

1 Ammon
1 Quatia

1 advanced
1 with

1 and
1 took
1 post
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 behind
1 a
1 small
1 village
1 about
1 three
1 miles
1 from
1 the

1 The
1 Houssas
1 were
1 skirmishing
1 in

1 These
1 entered
1 the
1 village
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 deserted
1 by

1 Ashantis
1 and

1 on

1 which

1 opened
1 fire
1 To
1 their
1 surprise
1 the
1 British
1 instead
1 of
1 falling
1 back
1 opened
1 fire
1 in

1 the

1 Indians
1 and

1 discharging

1 left
1 Captain

1 with

1 on
1 the
1 right
1 The
1 Houssas
1 and
1 a

1 est
1 Indians
1 moved
1 along

1 path
1 in
1 the
1 center
1 The
1 remainder

1 the
1 force
1 remained
1 with
1 the
1 baggage
1 in
1 reserve
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 but
1 the
1 marines
1 and

1 pushed
1 their
1 way
1 steadily
1 through
1 the
1 wood
1 on
1 either
1 side
1 Captain
1 Freemantle
1 at

1 gained
1 a
1 point
1 where

1 could
1 play
1 on
1 Essarman
1 which
1 lay
1 in
1 the
1 heart
1 of

1 wood
1 and
1 opened
1 fire
1 but
1 not
1 until
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 struck
1 by
1 a
1 slug
1 which
1 passed
1 through
1 his
1 arm
1 Colonel
1 M
1 Neil
1 who
1 was
1 with

1 Houssas
1 also
1 received

1 wound
1 in
1 the
1 arm
1 and
1 thirty
1 -two
1 marines
1 and

1 were
1 wounded
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 gradually
1 driven
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 village
1 and
1 wood
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 being
1 killed
1 by
1 the
1 English
1 fire
1 Having
1 accomplished
1 this
1 the
1 British
1 force
1 rested
1 for
1 an
1 hour
1 and
1 then
1 moved
1 on
1 first
1 setting
1 fire
1 to
1 Essarman
1 which
1 was
1 a
1 very
1 large
1 village
1 A
1 great
1 quantity
1 of
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 powder
1 was
1 stored
1 there
1 and
1 each
1 explosion
1 excited
1 yells
1 of
1 rage
1 among
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 Their
1 general
1 was
1 especially
1 angry
1 that
1 two
1 large
1 war
1 drums
1 had
1 been
1 lost
1 So
1 great
1 was
1 the
1 effect
1 produced
1 upon
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 by
1 the
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 which
1 the
1 British
1 had
1 poured
1 into
1 every
1 bush
1 and
1 thicket
1 as
1 they
1 advanced
1 that
1 their
1 general
1 thought
1 it
1 expedient
1 to
1 draw
1 them
1 off
1 in
1 the
1 direction
1 of
1 his
1 main
1 body
1 instead
1 of
1 further
1 disputing
1 the
1 way
1 The
1 English
1 now
1 turned
1 off
1 towards
1 the
1 coast
1 marching
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 way
1 through
1 open
1 country
1 part
1 through
1 a
1 bush
1 so
1 dense
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 impossible
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 flank
1 attack
1 upon
1 them
1 here
1 In
1 such
1 cases
1 as
1 this
1 when
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 know
1 that
1 an
1 enemy
1 is
1 going
1 to
1 approach
1 through
1 a
1 dense
1 and
1 impassable
1 forest
1 they
1 cut
1 paths
1 through
1 it
1 parallel
1 to
1 that
1 by
1 which
1 he
1 must
1 advance
1 and
1 at
1 a
1 few
1 yards
1 distance
1 Then
1 lying
1 in
1 ambush
1 there
1 they
1 suddenly
1 open
1 fire
1 upon
1 him
1 as
1 he
1 comes
1 along
1 As
1 no
1 idea
1 of
1 the
1 coming
1 of
1 the
1 English
1 had
1 been
1 entertained
1 they
1 passed
1 through
1 the
1 dense
1 thickets
1 in
1 single
1 file
1 unmolested
1 These
1 native
1 paths
1 are
1 very
1 difficult
1 and
1 unpleasant
1 walking
1 The
1 natives
1 always
1 walk
1 in
1 single
1 file
1 and
1 the
1 action
1 of
1 their
1 feet
1 aided
1 by
1 that
1 of
1 the
1 rain
1 often
1 wears
1 the
1 paths
1 into
1 a
1 deep
1 V
1 -shaped
1 rut
1 two
1 feet
1 in
1 depth
1 Burning
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 villages
1 by

1 way
1 the
1 column
1 reached
1 the
1 coast
1 at
1 a
1 spot
1 five
1 miles
1 from
1 Elmina
1 having
1 marched
1 nine
1 miles
1 As
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 known
1 to
1 be
1 in
1 force
1 at
1 the
1 villages
1 of
1 Akimfoo
1 and
1 Ampene
1 four
1 miles
1 farther
1 a
1 party
1 was
1 taken
1 on
1 to
1 this
1 point
1 Akimfoo
1 was
1 occupied
1 without
1 resistance
1 but
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 fought
1 hard
1 in
1 Ampene
1 but
1 were
1 driven
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 into
1 the
1 bush
1 from
1 which
1 the
1 British
1 force
1 was
1 too
1 small
1 to
1 drive
1 them
1 and
1 therefore
1 returned
1 to
1 Elmina
1 having
1 marched
1 twenty
1 -two
1 miles
1 a
1 prodigious
1 journey
1 in
1 such

1 Europeans
1 The
1 effect
1 produced
1 among
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 by
1 the
1 day
1 s
1 fighting
1 was
1 immense
1 All
1 their
1 theories
1 that
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 could
1 not
1 fight
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 were
1 roughly
1 upset
1 and
1 they
1 found
1 that
1 his
1 superiority
1 was
1 as
1 great
1 there
1 as
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 in
1 the
1 open
1 His
1 heavy
1 bullets
1 even
1 at
1 the
1 distance
1 of
1 some
1 hundred
1 yards
1 crashed
1 through
1 the
1 brush

1 with
1 deadly
1 effect
1 while
1 the
1 slugs
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 would
1 not
1 penetrate
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 much
1 exceeding
1 fifty
1 yards
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 was
1 profoundly
1 depressed
1 in
1 spirits
1 that
1 evening
1 The
1 white
1 men
1 who
1 come
1 to
1 fight
1 us
1 he
1 said
1 are
1 not
1 like
1 those
1 who
1 come
1 to
1 trade
1 ho
1 ever
1 heard
1 of
1 their
1 making
1 long
1 marches
1 hy
1 if
1 they
1 go
1 the
1 shortest
1 distances
1 they
1 are
1 carried
1 in

1 These
1 men
1 march
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 my
1 warriors
1 They
1 have
1 guns
1 which
1 shoot
1 ten
1 times
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 ours
1 and
1 never
1 stop
1 firing
1 They
1 carry
1 cannon
1 with
1 them
1 and
1 have
1 things
1 which
1 fly
1 through
1 the
1 air
1 and

1 and
1 set
1 villages
1 on

1 and

1 I
1 have
1 never

1 They

1 At

1 without

1 and

1 Besides
1 the
1 rockets
1 require
1 great
1 skill
1 in

1 otherwise
1 they
1 will
1 sometimes
1 come
1 back
1 and

1 the

1 you
1 not
1 tell
1 me
1 that
1 the

1 I
1 told

1 that

1 would
1 be
1 a
1 change
1 when

1 came
1 and

1 A

1 Two
1 days
1 later
1 Sir

1 for

1 ten

1 On
1 the

1 day
1 the

1 who
1 commanded
1 at

1 from

1 In

1 Colonel

1 After
1 a
1 three
1 mile
1 march
1 in
1 perfect
1 silence
1 they
1 came
1 upon
1 an
1 Ashanti
1 cutting
1 wood
1 and
1 compelled
1 him
1 to
1 act
1 as
1 guide
1 The
1 path
1 divided
1 into
1 three
1 and
1 the
1 Annamaboes
1 who
1 led
1 the
1 advance
1 when
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 camp
1 gave
1 a
1 sudden
1 cheer
1 and
1 rushed
1 in
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 panic
1 stricken
1 at
1 the
1 sudden
1 attack
1 fled
1 instantly
1 from
1 the

1 into
1 the
1 bush
1 Sudden
1 as
1 was
1 the

1 Frank
1 s

1 did
1 not
1 forget
1 their
1 duty
1 but

1 off

1 them
1 in
1 their
1 flight
1 by
1 the

1 of
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 The
1 latter
1 ordered
1 the
1 war
1 drums
1 to
1 begin
1 to
1 beat
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 surprised
1 at
1 the
1 quickness
1 with
1 which
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 recovered
1 from
1 their
1 panic
1 In
1 five
1 minutes
1 a
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 was
1 opened
1 from
1 the
1 whole
1 circle
1 of
1 bush
1 upon
1 the
1 camp
1 This
1 stood
1 on
1 rising
1 ground
1 and
1 the
1 British
1 force
1 returned
1 the
1 fire
1 with
1 great
1 rapidity
1 and
1 effect
1 The
1 Annamaboe
1 men
1 stood
1 their
1 ground
1 gallantly
1 and
1 the
1 est
1 Indians
1 fought
1 with
1 great
1 coolness
1 keeping
1 up
1 a
1 constant
1 and
1 heavy
1 fire
1 with
1 their
1 Sniders
1 The
1 Houssas
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 trained
1 as
1 artillerymen
1 worked
1 their
1 gun
1 and
1 rocket
1 tube
1 with
1 great
1 energy
1 yelling
1 and
1 whooping
1 as
1 each
1 round
1 of
1 grape
1 or
1 canister
1 was
1 fired
1 into
1 the
1 bush
1 or
1 each
1 rocket
1 whizzed
1 out
1 Notwithstanding
1 the
1 heavy
1 loss
1 which
1 they
1 were
1 suffering
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 stood
1 their
1 ground
1 most
1 bravely
1 Their
1 wild
1 yells
1 and
1 the
1 beating
1 of
1 their
1 drums
1 never
1 ceased
1 and
1 only
1 rose
1 the
1 louder
1 as
1 each
1 volley
1 of
1 grape
1 was
1 poured
1 into
1 them
1 They
1 did
1 not
1 however
1 advance
1 beyond
1 the
1 shelter
1 of
1 their
1 bush
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 British
1 were
1 not
1 strong
1 enough
1 to
1 attack
1 them
1 there
1 the
1 duel
1 of
1 artillery
1 and
1 musketry
1 was
1 continued
1 without
1 cessation
1 for
1 an
1 hour
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 and
1 then
1 Colonel
1 Festing
1 fell
1 back
1 unmolested
1 to
1 Dunquah
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 delighted
1 at
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 the
1 fighting
1 heavy
1 as
1 their
1 loss
1 had
1 been
1 They
1 had
1 held
1 their
1 ground
1 and
1 the
1 British
1 had
1 not
1 ventured
1 to
1 attack
1 them
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 You
1 see
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 said
1 exultingly
1 to
1 Frank
1 what
1 I
1 told
1 you
1 was
1 true
1 The
1 white
1 men
1 cannot
1 fight
1 us
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 At
1 Essarman
1 the
1 wood
1 was
1 thin
1 and
1 gave
1 but
1 a
1 poor
1 cover
1 Here
1 you
1 see
1 they
1 dared
1 not
1 follow
1 us
1 On
1 the
1 British
1 side
1 five
1 officers
1 and
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Annamaboe
1 were
1 wounded
1 and
1 fifty
1 -two
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 None
1 were
1 killed
1 the
1 distance
1 from
1 the
1 bush
1 to
1 the
1 ground
1 held
1 by
1 the
1 English
1 being
1 too
1 far
1 for
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 slugs
1 to
1 inflict
1 mortal
1 wounds
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 now
1 began
1 to
1 meditate
1 falling
1 back
1 upon
1 the
1 Prah
1 -
1 -
1 the
1 sick
1 and
1 wounded
1 were
1 already
1 sent
1 back
1 -
1 -but
1 he
1 determined
1 before
1 retiring
1 to
1 attack
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 whose
1 king
1 had
1 sided
1 with
1 us
1 and
1 where
1 an
1 English
1 garrison
1 had
1 been
1 posted
1 On
1 the
1 2d
1 of
1 November
1 however
1 Colonel
1 Festing
1 again
1 marched
1 out
1 from
1 Dunquah
1 with
1 a
1 hundred
1 men
1 of
1 the
1 2d
1 est
1 India
1 regiment
1 nine
1 hundred
1 native
1 allies
1 and
1 some
1 Houssas
1 with
1 rockets
1 under
1 Lieutenant
1 ilmot
1 towards
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 camp
1 This
1 time
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 was
1 not
1 taken
1 by
1 surprise
1 His
1 scouts
1 informed
1 him
1 of
1 the
1 approach
1 of
1 the
1 column
1 and
1 moving
1 out
1 to
1 meet
1 them
1 he
1 attacked
1 them
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 before
1 they
1 reached
1 the
1 camp
1 Crouching
1 among
1 the
1 trees
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 opened
1 a
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 All
1 the
1 native
1 allies
1 with
1 the
1 exception
1 of
1 a
1 hundred
1 bolted
1 at
1 once
1 but
1 the
1 remainder
1 with
1 the
1 Houssas
1 and
1 est
1 Indians
1 behaved
1 with
1 great
1 steadiness
1 and
1 gallantry
1 and
1 for
1 two
1 hours
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 heavy
1 Snider
1 fire
1 upon
1 their
1 invisible
1 foes
1 Early
1 in
1 the
1 fight
1 Lieutenant
1 ilmot
1 while
1 directing
1 the
1 rocket
1 tube
1 received
1 a
1 severe
1 wound
1 in
1 the
1 shoulder
1 He
1 however
1 continued
1 at
1 his
1 work
1 till
1 just
1 as
1 the
1 fight
1 was
1 ended
1 he
1 was
1 shot
1 through
1 the
1 heart
1 with
1 a
1 bullet
1 Four
1 officers
1 were
1 wounded
1 as
1 were
1 thirteen
1 men
1 of
1 the
1 2d
1 est
1 India
1 regiment
1 One
1 of
1 the
1 natives
1 was
1 killed
1 fifty
1 severely
1 wounded
1 and
1 a
1 great
1 many
1 slightly
1 After
1 two
1 hours
1 fighting
1 Colonel
1 Festing
1 found
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 working
1 round
1 to
1 cut
1 off
1 his
1 retreat
1 and
1 therefore
1 fell
1 back
1 again
1 on
1 Dunquah
1 The
1 conduct
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 levies
1 here
1 and
1 in
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 smaller
1 reconnaisances
1 was
1 so
1 bad
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 found
1 that
1 no
1 further
1 dependence
1 could
1 be
1 placed
1 upon
1 them
1 and
1 with
1 the
1 exception
1 of
1 the
1 two
1 partly
1 disciplined
1 regiments
1 under
1 Colonel
1 ood
1 and
1 Major
1 Russell
1 they
1 were
1 in
1 future
1 treated
1 as
1 merely
1 fit
1 to
1 act
1 as
1 carriers
1 for
1 the
1 provisions
1 Although
1 the
1 second
1 reconnaissance
1 from
1 Dunquah
1 had
1 like
1 the
1 first
1 been
1 unsuccessful
1 its
1 effect
1 upon
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 was
1 very
1 great
1 They
1 had
1 themselves
1 suffered
1 great
1 loss
1 while
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 see
1 that
1 any
1 of
1 their
1 enemies
1 had
1 been
1 killed
1 for
1 Lieutenant
1 ilmot
1 s
1 body
1 had
1 been
1 carried
1 off
1 The
1 rockets
1 especially
1 appalled
1 them
1 one
1 rocket
1 having
1 killed
1 six
1 four
1 of
1 whom
1 were
1 chiefs
1 who
1 were
1 talking
1 together
1 It
1 was
1 true
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 had
1 not
1 succeeded
1 in
1 forcing
1 their
1 way
1 through
1 the
1 bush
1 but
1 if
1 every
1 time
1 they
1 came
1 out
1 they
1 were
1 to
1 kill
1 large
1 numbers
1 without
1 suffering
1 any

1 they
1 must
1 clearly
1 in
1 the
1 long
1 run
1 be
1 victorious
1 hat
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 did
1 not
1 see
1 and
1 what
1 Frank
1 carefully
1 abstained
1 from
1 hinting
1 to
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 was
1 that
1 if
1 instead
1 of
1 stopping
1 and
1 firing
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 beyond
1 that
1 which
1 at
1 their
1 slugs
1 were
1 effective
1 they
1 were
1 to
1 charge
1 down
1 upon
1 the
1 English
1 and
1 fire
1 their
1 pieces
1 when
1 they
1 reached
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 yards
1 of
1 them
1 they
1 would
1 overpower
1 them
1 at
1 once
1 by
1 their
1 enormous
1 superiority
1 of
1 numbers
1 At
1 ten
1 paces
1 distant
1 a
1 volley
1 of
1 slugs
1 is
1 as
1 effective
1 as
1 a
1 Snider
1 bullet
1 and
1 the
1 whole
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 troops
1 would
1 have
1 bolted
1 the
1 instant
1 such
1 a
1 charge
1 was
1 made
1 In
1 the
1 open
1 such
1 tactics
1 might
1 not
1 be
1 possible
1 as
1 the
1 Sniders
1 could
1 be
1 discharged
1 twenty
1 times
1 before
1 the
1 English
1 line
1 was
1 reached
1 but
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 where
1 the
1 two
1 lines
1 were
1 not
1 more
1 than
1 forty
1 or
1 fifty
1 yards
1 apart
1 the
1 Sniders
1 could
1 be
1 fired
1 but
1 once
1 or
1 at
1 the
1 utmost
1 twice
1 while
1 the
1 assailants
1 rushed
1 across
1 the
1 short
1 intervening
1 space
1 Had
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 adopted
1 these
1 tactics
1 they
1 could
1 have
1 crushed
1 with
1 ease
1 the
1 little
1 bands
1 with
1 which
1 the
1 English
1 attacked
1 them
1 But
1 it
1 is
1 characteristic
1 of

1 that
1 they

1 to

1 down
1 upon

1 to
1 keep
1 a
1 whole
1 tribe
1 of
1 Red
1 Indians
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 on
1 the
1 prairie
1 This
1 however
1 can
1 be
1 accounted
1 for
1 by
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 the
1 chiefs
1 is
1 limited
1 and
1 that
1 each
1 Indian
1 values
1 his
1 own
1 life
1 highly
1 and
1 does
1 not
1 care
1 to
1 throw
1 it
1 away
1 on
1 a
1 desperate
1 enterprise
1 Among
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 however
1 where
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 the
1 chiefs
1 is
1 very
1 great
1 and
1 where
1 human
1 life
1 is
1 held
1 of
1 little
1 account
1 it
1 is
1 singular
1 that
1 such
1 tactics
1 should
1 not
1 have
1 been
1 adopted
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 now
1 becoming
1 thoroughly
1 dispirited
1 Their
1 sufferings
1 had
1 been
1 immense
1 Fever
1 and
1 hunger
1 had
1 made
1 great
1 ravages
1 among
1 them
1 and
1 although
1 now
1 the
1 wet
1 season
1 was
1 over
1 a
1 large
1 quantity
1 of
1 food
1 could
1 be
1 obtained
1 in
1 the
1 forest
1 the
1 losses
1 which
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 s
1 bullets
1 rockets
1 and
1 guns
1 had
1 inflicted
1 upon
1 them
1 had
1 broken
1 their
1 courage
1 The
1 longing
1 for
1 home
1 became
1 greater
1 than
1 ever
1 and
1 had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 that
1 they
1 knew
1 that
1 troops
1 stationed
1 at
1 the
1 Prah
1 would
1 prevent
1 any
1 fugitives
1 from
1 crossing
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 deserted
1 in
1 large
1 numbers
1 Already
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 divisions
1 had
1 fallen
1 back
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 spent
1 hours
1 sitting
1 at
1 the
1 door
1 of
1 his
1 hut
1 smoking
1 and
1 talking
1 to
1 the
1 other
1 chiefs
1 Frank
1 was
1 often
1 called
1 into
1 council
1 as
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 had
1 conceived
1 a
1 high
1 opinion
1 of
1 his
1 judgment
1 which
1 had
1 proved
1 invariably
1 correct
1 so
1 far
1 e
1 are
1 going
1 he
1 said
1 one
1 day
1 to
1 take
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 and
1 to
1 kill
1 its
1 king
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 fall
1 back
1 across
1 the
1 Prah
1 I
1 think
1 you
1 had
1 better
1 fall
1 back
1 at
1 once
1 Frank
1 answered
1 hen
1 you
1 took
1 me
1 with
1 you
1 to
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 clearing
1 yesterday
1 I
1 saw
1 that
1 preparations
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 for
1 the
1 defense
1 and
1 that
1 there
1 were
1 white
1 troops
1 there
1 You
1 will
1 never
1 carry
1 the
1 village
1 The
1 English
1 have
1 thrown
1 up
1 breastworks
1 of
1 earth
1 and
1 they
1 will
1 lie
1 behind
1 these
1 and
1 shoot
1 down
1 your
1 men
1 as
1 they
1 come
1 out
1 of
1 the

1 I
1 must

1 one
1 victory
1 to

1 to
1 the
1 king
1 if
1 I
1 can
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 said
1 Then
1 he
1 can
1 make
1 peace
1 if
1 he
1 chooses
1 The
1 white
1 men
1 will
1 not
1 wish
1 to
1 go
1 on
1 fighting
1 The
1 Fantis
1 are
1 eager
1 for
1 peace
1 and
1 to
1 return
1 to
1 their
1 villages
1 hat
1 do
1 you
1 think
1 If
1 it
1 be
1 true
1 that

1 troops
1 are
1 coming
1 out
1 from
1 England
1 as
1 the
1 Fanti
1 prisoners
1 say
1 Frank
1 answered
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 that
1 the
1 English
1 will
1 not
1 make
1 peace
1 till
1 they
1 have
1 crossed
1 the
1 Prah
1 and
1 marched
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 Your
1 king
1 is
1 always
1 making
1 trouble
1 You
1 will
1 see
1 that
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 English
1 will
1 not
1 be
1 content
1 with
1 your
1 retiring
1 but
1 will
1 in
1 turn
1 invade
1 Ashanti
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 and
1 the

1 laughed
1 incredulously
1 They
1 will

1 If

1 They
1 are
1 not

1 to

1 up
1 Frank
1 answered
1 You
1 have
1 seen
1 how
1 a
1 hundred
1 or
1 two
1 can
1 fight
1 against
1 your

1 Your

1 It

1 CHAPTER
1 XX
1 THE
1 HITE
1 TROOPS
1 Two
1 days
1 later
1 Frank
1 was
1 awoke
1 by
1 a
1 sudden
1 yell
1 He
1 leaped
1 from
1 his
1 bed
1 of
1 boughs
1 seized
1 his
1 revolver
1 and
1 rushing
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 saw
1 that
1 a
1 party
1 of
1 some
1 twenty
1 men
1 were
1 attacking
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 s
1 hut
1 The
1 two
1 guards
1 stationed
1 there
1 had
1 already
1 been
1 cut
1 down
1 Frank
1 shouted
1 to
1 his
1 four
1 guards
1 and
1 Ostik
1 to
1 follow
1 him
1 The
1 guards
1 had
1 been
1 standing
1 irresolute
1 not
1 knowing
1 what
1 side
1 to
1 take
1 but
1 the
1 example
1 of
1 the
1 young
1 Englishman
1 decided
1 them
1 They
1 fired
1 their
1 muskets
1 into
1 the
1 knot
1 of
1 natives
1 and
1 then
1 charged
1 sword
1 in
1 hand
1 Ostik
1 drew
1 the
1 sword
1 which
1 he
1 always
1 carried
1 and
1 followed
1 close
1 to
1 his
1 master
1 s
1 heels
1 Frank
1 did
1 not
1 fire
1 until
1 within
1 two
1 yards
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 Then
1 his
1 revolver
1 spoke
1 out
1 and
1 six
1 shots
1 were
1 discharged
1 each
1 with
1 deadly
1 effect
1 Then
1 catching
1 up
1 a
1 musket
1 which
1 had
1 fallen
1 from
1 the
1 hands
1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 he
1 had
1 shot
1 he
1 clubbed
1 it
1 and
1 fell
1 upon
1 the
1 surprised
1 and
1 already
1 hesitating
1 conspirators
1 These
1 fortunately
1 for
1 Frank
1 had
1 not
1 loaded
1 their
1 muskets
1 They
1 had
1 intended
1 to
1 kill
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 disperse
1 instantly
1 before
1 aid
1 could
1 arrive
1 believing
1 that
1 with
1 his
1 death
1 the
1 order
1 for
1 retreat
1 across
1 the
1 Prah
1 would
1 at
1 once
1 be
1 given
1 Several
1 of
1 them
1 had
1 been
1 killed
1 by
1 the
1 slugs
1 from
1 the
1 muskets
1 of
1 Frank
1 s
1 guard
1 and
1 his
1 pistol
1 had
1 completed
1 their
1 confusion
1 The
1 reports
1 of
1 the
1 guns
1 called
1 up
1 other
1 troops
1 and
1 these
1 came
1 rushing
1 in
1 on
1 all
1 sides
1 Scarcely
1 did
1 Frank
1 and
1 his
1 followers
1 fall
1 upon
1 the
1 conspirators
1 than
1 they
1 took
1 to
1 their
1 heels
1 and
1 fled
1 into
1 the
1 wood
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 himself
1 sword
1 in
1 hand
1 had
1 just
1 sprung
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 of
1 the
1 hut
1 prepared
1 to
1 sell
1 his
1 life
1 dearly
1 when
1 Frank
1 s
1 guard
1 fired
1 The
1 affair
1 was
1 so
1 momentary
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 hardly
1 time
1 to
1 realize
1 what
1 had
1 happened
1 before
1 his
1 assailants
1 were
1 in
1 full
1 flight
1 You
1 have
1 saved
1 my
1 life
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 Had
1 it
1 not
1 been
1 for
1 you
1 I
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 killed
1 You
1 shall
1 not
1 find
1 me
1 ungrateful
1 hen
1 I
1 have
1 taken
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 I
1 will
1 manage
1 that
1 you
1 shall
1 return
1 to
1 your
1 friends
1 I
1 dare
1 not
1 let
1 you
1 go
1 openly
1 for
1 the
1 king
1 would
1 not
1 forgive
1 me
1 and
1 I
1 shall
1 have
1 enough
1 to
1 do
1 already
1 to
1 pacify
1 him
1 when
1 he
1 hears
1 how
1 great
1 have
1 been
1 our
1 losses
1 But
1 rest
1 content
1 I
1 will
1 manage
1 it
1 somehow
1 An
1 hour
1 afterwards
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 gave
1 orders
1 that
1 the
1 army
1 should
1 move
1 to
1 the
1 attack
1 of
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 The
1 place
1 was
1 held
1 by
1 a
1 body
1 of
1 marines
1 and
1 sailors
1 a
1 hundred
1 est
1 Indians
1 and
1 the
1 native
1 troops
1 of
1 the
1 king
1 Major
1 Russell
1 was
1 in
1 command
1 The
1 village
1 stood
1 on
1 rising
1 ground
1 and
1 was
1 surrounded
1 for
1 a
1 distance
1 of
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 fifty
1 yards
1 by
1 a
1 clearing
1 Part
1 of
1 this
1 consisted
1 of
1 patches
1 of
1 cultivated
1 ground
1 the
1 rest
1 had
1 been
1 hastily
1 cleared
1 by
1 the
1 defenders
1 At
1 the
1 upper
1 end
1 stood
1 a
1 church
1 and
1 this
1 was
1 converted
1 into
1 a
1 stronghold
1 The
1 windows
1 were
1 high
1 up
1 in
1 the
1 walls
1 and
1 a
1 platform
1 had
1 been
1 erected
1 inside
1 for
1 the
1 sailors
1 to
1 fire
1 from
1 the
1 windows
1 which
1 were
1 partially
1 blocked
1 with
1 sandbags
1 The
1 houses
1 on
1 the
1 outside
1 of
1 the
1 village
1 had
1 all
1 been
1 loopholed
1 and
1 had
1 been
1 connected
1 by
1 breastworks
1 of
1 earth
1 Other
1 defenses
1 had
1 been
1 thrown
1 up
1 further
1 back
1 in
1 case
1 the
1 outworks
1 should
1 be
1 carried
1 The
1 mission
1 house
1 in
1 the
1 main
1 street
1 and
1 the
1 huts
1 which
1 surrounded
1 it
1 formed
1 with
1 the
1 church
1 the
1 last
1 strongholds
1 For
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 days
1 the
1 bush
1 round
1 the
1 town
1 had
1 swarmed
1 with
1 Ashantis
1 whose
1 tomtoms
1 could
1 be
1 heard
1 by
1 the
1 garrison
1 night
1 and
1 day
1 Frank
1 accompanied
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 and
1 was
1 therefore
1 in
1 the
1 front
1 and
1 had
1 an
1 opportunity
1 of
1 seeing
1 how
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 commence
1 an
1 attack
1 The
1 war
1 drums
1 gave
1 the
1 signal
1 and
1 when
1 they
1 ceased
1 ten
1 thousand
1 voices
1 raised
1 the
1 war
1 song
1 in
1 measured
1 cadence
1 The
1 effect
1 was
1 very
1 fine
1 rising
1 as
1 it
1 did
1 from
1 all
1 parts
1 of
1 the
1 forest
1 By
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 lined
1 the
1 whole
1 circle
1 of
1 wood
1 round
1 the
1 clearing
1 Then
1 three
1 regular
1 volleys
1 were
1 fired
1 making
1 from
1 the
1 heavy
1 charges
1 used
1 a
1 tremendous
1 roar
1 Scarcely
1 had
1 these
1 ceased
1 when
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Abra
1 a
1 splendid
1 looking
1 negro
1 standing
1 nearly
1 six
1 feet
1 four
1 in
1 height
1 stepped
1 out
1 from
1 behind
1 the
1 breastwork
1 and
1 shouted
1 a
1 taunting
1 challenge
1 to
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 to
1 come
1 on
1 They
1 replied
1 with
1 a
1 loud
1 yell
1 and
1 with
1 the
1 opening
1 of
1 a
1 continuous
1 fire
1 round
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 wood
1 On
1 wall
1 and
1 roof
1 of
1 the
1 village
1 the
1 slugs
1 pattered
1 thickly
1 but
1 the
1 defenders
1 were
1 all
1 in
1 shelter
1 and
1 in
1 reply
1 from
1 breastwork
1 and
1 loophole
1 from
1 the
1 windows
1 and
1 roof
1 of
1 the
1 church
1 the
1 answering
1 Snider
1 bullets
1 flew
1 out
1 straight
1 and
1 deadly
1 Several
1 times
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 tried
1 to
1 get
1 his
1 men
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 rush
1 The
1 war
1 drums
1 beat
1 the
1 great
1 horns
1 sounded
1 and
1 the
1 men
1 shouted
1 but
1 each
1 time
1 the
1 English
1 bullets
1 flew
1 so
1 thick
1 and
1 deadly
1 into
1 the
1 wood
1 wherever
1 the
1 sound
1 rose
1 loudest
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 heart
1 failed
1 them
1 and
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 got
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 rush
1 across
1 the
1 hundred
1 yards
1 of
1 cleared
1 ground
1 At
1 five
1 o
1 clock
1 the
1 fire
1 slackened
1 but
1 shortly
1 after
1 dark
1 the
1 attack
1 recommenced
1 The
1 moon
1 was
1 up
1 and
1 full
1 Frank
1 feared
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 would
1 try
1 and
1 crawl
1 a
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 distance
1 across
1 the
1 clearing
1 and
1 then
1 make
1 a
1 sudden
1 rush
1 but
1 they
1 appeared
1 to
1 have
1 no
1 idea
1 of
1 a
1 silent
1 attack
1 Several
1 times
1 indeed
1 they
1 gathered
1 and
1 rushed
1 forward
1 in
1 large
1 bodies
1 but
1 each
1 time
1 their
1 shouting
1 and
1 drums
1 gave
1 warning
1 to
1 the
1 besieged
1 and
1 so
1 tremendous
1 a
1 fire
1 was
1 opened
1 upon
1 them
1 when
1 they
1 emerged
1 from
1 the
1 shadow
1 of
1 the
1 trees
1 into
1 the
1 moonlight
1 that
1 each
1 time
1 they
1 fell
1 back
1 leaving
1 the
1 ground
1 strewn
1 with
1 dead
1 Till
1 midnight
1 the
1 attack
1 was
1 continued
1 then
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 fell
1 back
1 to
1 their
1 camp
1 At
1 Accroful
1 a
1 village
1 on
1 the
1 main
1 road
1 some
1 four
1 miles
1 distant
1 the
1 attack
1 had
1 been
1 heard
1 and
1 a
1 messenger
1 sent
1 off
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 to
1 inform
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 fifty
1 men
1 of
1 the
1 2d
1 est
1 India
1 regiment
1 marched
1 from
1 Accroful
1 into
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 without
1 molestation
1 Later
1 on
1 some
1 Abra
1 scouts
1 approached
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 camp
1 and
1 shouted
1 tauntingly
1 to
1 know
1 when
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 coming
1 into
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 They
1 shouted
1 in
1 return
1 After
1 breakfast
1 and
1 soon
1 afterwards
1 a
1 rocket
1 fired
1 from
1 the
1 roof
1 of
1 the
1 church
1 falling
1 into
1 the
1 camp
1 they
1 again
1 sallied
1 out
1 and
1 attacked
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 repetition
1 of
1 the
1 fight
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 before
1 Several
1 times
1 Major
1 Russell
1 withheld
1 his
1 fire
1 altogether
1 but
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 tempted
1 to
1 show
1 in
1 force
1 beyond
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 wood
1 So
1 inspirited
1 were
1 the
1 defenders
1 that
1 they
1 now
1 made
1 several
1 sorties
1 and
1 penetrated
1 some
1 distance
1 into
1 the
1 wood
1 At
1 eight
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 had
1 marched
1 from
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 with
1 three
1 hundred
1 marines
1 and
1 blue
1 jackets
1 to
1 the
1 relief
1 of
1 the
1 position
1 but
1 so
1 tremendous
1 was
1 the
1 heat
1 that
1 nearly
1 half
1 the
1 men
1 fell
1 exhausted
1 by
1 the
1 way
1 and
1 were
1 ordered
1 when
1 they
1 recovered
1 to
1 march
1 back
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 The
1 remainder
1 when
1 they
1 arrived
1 at
1 Assaibo
1 five
1 miles
1 from
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 were
1 so
1 utterly
1 exhausted
1 that
1 a
1 long
1 halt
1 was
1 necessary
1 although
1 a
1 faint
1 but
1 continuous
1 fire
1 could
1 be
1 heard
1 from
1 the
1 besieged
1 place
1 Chocolate
1 and
1 cold
1 preserved
1 meat
1 were
1 served
1 out
1 to
1 the
1 men
1 and
1 in
1 the
1 course
1 of
1 another
1 three
1 hours
1 a
1 large
1 number
1 of
1 the
1 stragglers
1 came
1 in
1 At
1 three
1 o
1 clock
1 a
1 hundred
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 exhausted
1 men
1 being
1 left
1 to
1 hold
1 the
1 village
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 the
1 force
1 with
1 the
1 fifty
1 est
1 Indians
1 stationed
1 there
1 marched
1 forward
1 to
1 Buteana
1 where
1 they
1 were
1 jointed
1 by
1 fifty
1 more
1 men
1 from
1 Accroful
1 Just
1 as
1 they
1 started
1 from
1 this
1 place
1 they
1 met
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Abra
1 who
1 had
1 come
1 out
1 with
1 a
1 small
1 body
1 of
1 warriors
1 from
1 him
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 learned
1 that
1 this
1 road
1 which
1 wound
1 round
1 and
1 came
1 in
1 at
1 the
1 back
1 of
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 was
1 still
1 open
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 too
1 busy
1 with
1 their
1 own
1 operations
1 to
1 watch
1 the
1 path
1 and
1 the
1 relieving
1 force
1 entered
1 the
1 place
1 without
1 firing
1 a
1 shot
1 The
1 firing
1 round
1 the
1 town
1 continued
1 but
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 when
1 he
1 saw
1 the
1 reinforcements
1 enter
1 at
1 once
1 began
1 to
1 fall
1 back
1 with
1 the
1 main
1 body
1 of
1 his
1 troops
1 and
1 although
1 the
1 firing
1 was
1 kept
1 up
1 all
1 night
1 when
1 the
1 besieged
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 advanced
1 to
1 attack
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 camp
1 they
1 found
1 it
1 altogether
1 deserted
1 It
1 is
1 of
1 no
1 use
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 general
1 said
1 to
1 Frank
1 My
1 men
1 cannot
1 fight
1 in
1 the
1 open
1 against
1 the
1 English
1 guns
1 Besides
1 they
1 do
1 not
1 know
1 what
1 they
1 are
1 fighting
1 for
1 here
1 but
1 if
1 your
1 general
1 should
1 ever
1 cross
1 the
1 Prah
1 you
1 will
1 find
1 it
1 different
1 There
1 are
1 forests
1 all
1 the
1 way
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 as
1 you
1 know
1 and
1 the
1 men
1 will
1 be
1 fighting
1 in
1 defense
1 of
1 their
1 own
1 country
1 you
1 will
1 see
1 what
1 we
1 shall
1 do
1 then
1 And
1 now
1 I
1 will
1 keep
1 my
1 promise
1 to
1 you
1 Tonight
1 your
1 guards
1 will
1 go
1 to
1 sleep
1 I
1 shall
1 have
1 medicine
1 given
1 them
1 which
1 will
1 make
1 them
1 sleep
1 hard
1 One
1 of
1 the
1 Fanti
1 prisoners
1 will
1 come
1 to
1 your
1 hut
1 and
1 will
1 guide
1 you
1 through
1 the
1 woods
1 to
1 Assaiboo
1 Goodbye
1 my
1 friend
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 has
1 learnt
1 that
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 men
1 are
1 good
1 and
1 honest
1 and
1 he
1 will
1 never
1 forget
1 that
1 he
1 owes
1 his
1 life
1 to
1 you
1 Take
1 this
1 in
1 remembrance
1 of
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 And
1 he
1 presented
1 Frank
1 with
1 a
1 necklace
1 composed
1 of
1 nuggets
1 of
1 gold
1 as
1 big
1 as
1 walnuts
1 and
1 weighing
1 nearly
1 twenty
1 pounds
1 Frank
1 in
1 return
1 gave
1 the
1 general
1 the
1 only
1 article
1 of
1 value
1 which
1 he
1 now
1 possessed
1 his
1 revolver
1 and
1 tin
1 box
1 of
1 cartridges
1 telling
1 him
1 that
1 he
1 hoped
1 he
1 would
1 never
1 use
1 it
1 against
1 the
1 English
1 but
1 that
1 it
1 might
1 be
1 of
1 value
1 to
1 him
1 should
1 he
1 ever
1 again
1 have
1 trouble
1 with
1 his
1 own
1 men
1 Frank
1 made
1 a
1 parcel
1 of
1 the
1 necklace
1 and
1 of
1 the
1 gold
1 he
1 had
1 received
1 from
1 the
1 king
1 for
1 his
1 goods
1 and
1 warned
1 Ostik
1 to
1 hold
1 himself
1 in
1 readiness
1 for
1 flight
1 The
1 camp
1 was
1 silent
1 although
1 the
1 roar
1 of
1 musketry
1 a
1 few
1 hundred
1 yards
1 off
1 round
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 continued
1 unbroken
1 For
1 some
1 time
1 Frank
1 heard
1 his
1 guards
1 pacing
1 outside
1 and
1 occasionally
1 speaking
1 to
1 each
1 other
1 Then
1 these
1 sounds
1 ceased
1 and
1 all
1 was
1 quiet
1 Presently
1 the
1 front
1 of
1 the
1 tent
1 was
1 opened
1 and
1 a
1 voice
1 said
1 Come
1 all
1 is
1 ready
1 Frank
1 came
1 out
1 and
1 looked
1 round
1 The
1 Ashanti
1 camp
1 was
1 deserted
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 had
1 moved
1 away
1 with
1 the
1 main
1 body
1 of
1 his
1 troops
1 although
1 the
1 musketry
1 fire
1 round
1 the
1 village
1 was
1 kept
1 up
1 A
1 Fanti
1 stood
1 at
1 the
1 door
1 of
1 the
1 hut
1 with
1 Ostik
1 The
1 four
1 guards
1 were
1 sleeping
1 quietly
1 Noiselessly
1 the
1 little
1 party
1 stole
1 away
1 A
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 later
1 they
1 struck
1 the
1 path
1 and
1 an
1 hour
1 s
1 walking
1 brought
1 them
1 to
1 Assaiboo
1 Not
1 an
1 Ashanti
1 was
1 met
1 with
1 along
1 the
1 path
1 but
1 Frank
1 hardly
1 felt
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 safe
1 until
1 he
1 heard
1 the
1 challenge
1 of
1 ho
1 goes
1 there
1 from
1 an
1 English
1 sentry
1 A
1 few
1 minutes
1 later
1 he
1 was
1 taken
1 before
1 Captain
1 Bradshaw
1 R
1 N
1 who
1 commanded
1 the
1 sailors
1 and
1 marines
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 left
1 there
1 Very
1 hearty
1 was
1 the
1 greeting
1 which
1 the
1 young
1 Englishman
1 received
1 from
1 the
1 genial
1 sailor
1 and
1 a
1 bowl
1 of
1 soup
1 and
1 a
1 glass
1 of
1 grog
1 were
1 soon
1 set
1 before
1 him
1 His
1 arrival
1 created
1 quite
1 a
1 sensation
1 and
1 for
1 some
1 hours
1 he
1 sat
1 talking
1 with
1 the
1 officers
1 while
1 Ostik
1 was
1 an
1 equal
1 subject
1 of
1 curiosity
1 among
1 the
1 sailors
1 The
1 news
1 that
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 army
1 was
1 in
1 full
1 retreat
1 relieved
1 the
1 garrison
1 of
1 the
1 place
1 from
1 all
1 further
1 fear
1 of
1 attack
1 and
1 Frank
1 went
1 to
1 sleep
1 before
1 morning
1 and
1 was
1 only
1 roused
1 at
1 noon
1 when
1 a
1 messenger
1 arrived
1 with
1 the
1 news
1 that
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 camp
1 had
1 been
1 found
1 deserted
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 road
1 in
1 its
1 rear
1 was
1 found
1 to
1 be
1 strewn
1 with
1 chairs
1 clothes
1 pillows
1 muskets
1 and
1 odds
1 and
1 ends
1 of
1 every
1 description
1 Few
1 Ashanti
1 prisoners
1 had
1 been
1 taken
1 but
1 a
1 considerable
1 number
1 of
1 Fantis
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 prisoners
1 among
1 them
1 had
1 come
1 in
1 having
1 escaped
1 in
1 the
1 confusion
1 of
1 the
1 retreat
1 Among
1 these
1 were
1 many
1 women
1 several
1 of
1 whom
1 had
1 been
1 captured
1 when
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 first
1 crossed
1 the
1 Prah
1 ten
1 months
1 before
1 In
1 the
1 afternoon
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 with
1 the
1 greater
1 portion
1 of
1 the
1 force
1 from
1 Abra
1 Crampa
1 marched
1 in
1 and
1 Frank
1 was
1 introduced
1 by
1 Captain
1 Bradshaw
1 to
1 the
1 general
1 As
1 the
1 latter
1 was
1 anxious
1 to
1 press
1 on
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 in
1 order
1 that
1 the
1 sailors
1 and
1 marines
1 might
1 sleep
1 on
1 board
1 ship
1 that
1 night
1 he
1 asked
1 Frank
1 to
1 accompany
1 him
1 and
1 on
1 the
1 road
1 heard
1 the
1 story
1 of
1 his
1 adventures
1 He
1 invited
1 him
1 to
1 sleep
1 for
1 the
1 night
1 at
1 Government
1 House
1 an
1 invitation
1 which
1 Frank
1 accepted
1 but
1 he
1 slept
1 worse
1 than
1 he
1 had
1 done
1 for
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 It
1 was
1 now
1 nearly
1 two
1 years
1 since
1 he
1 had
1 landed
1 in
1 Africa
1 and
1 during
1 all
1 that
1 time
1 he
1 had
1 slept
1 covered
1 with
1 a
1 rug
1 on
1 the
1 canvas
1 of
1 his
1 little
1 camp
1 bed
1 The
1 complete
1 change
1 the
1 stillness
1 and
1 security
1 and
1 above
1 all
1 the
1 novelty
1 of
1 a
1 bed
1 with
1 sheets
1 completely
1 banished
1 sleep
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 not
1 until
1 morning
1 was
1 dawning
1 that
1 wrapping
1 himself
1 in
1 a
1 rug
1 and
1 lying
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 he
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 get
1 a
1 sleep
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 at
1 breakfast
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 asked
1 him
1 what
1 he
1 intended
1 to
1 do
1 and
1 said
1 that
1 if
1 he
1 were
1 in
1 no
1 extreme
1 hurry
1 to
1 return
1 to
1 England
1 he
1 could
1 render
1 great
1 services
1 as
1 guide
1 to
1 the
1 expedition
1 which
1 would
1 start
1 for
1 Coomassie
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 the
1 white
1 troops
1 arrived
1 Frank
1 had
1 already
1 thought
1 the
1 matter
1 over
1 He
1 had
1 had
1 more
1 than
1 enough
1 of
1 Africa
1 but
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 months
1 longer
1 would
1 make
1 no
1 difference
1 and
1 he
1 felt
1 that
1 his
1 knowledge
1 of
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 methods
1 of
1 war
1 of
1 the
1 country
1 to
1 be
1 traversed
1 the
1 streams
1 to
1 be
1 crossed
1 and
1 the
1 points
1 at
1 which
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 would
1 probably
1 make
1 a
1 stand
1 would
1 enable
1 him
1 to
1 tender
1 really
1 valuable
1 assistance
1 to
1 the
1 army
1 He
1 therefore
1 told
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 no
1 particular
1 business
1 which
1 called
1 him
1 urgently
1 back
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 willing
1 to
1 guide
1 the
1 army
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 He
1 at
1 once
1 had
1 quarters
1 as
1 an
1 officer
1 assigned
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 with
1 rations
1 for
1 himself
1 and
1 servant
1 His
1 first
1 step
1 was
1 to
1 procure
1 English
1 garments
1 for
1 although
1 he
1 had
1 before
1 starting
1 laid
1 aside
1 his
1 Ashanti
1 costume
1 and
1 put
1 on
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 before
1 worn
1 his
1 clothes
1 were
1 now
1 so
1 travel
1 worn
1 as
1 to
1 be
1 scarce
1 wearable
1 He
1 had
1 no
1 difficulty
1 in
1 doing
1 this
1 Many
1 of
1 the
1 officers
1 were
1 already
1 invalided
1 home
1 and
1 one
1 who
1 was
1 just
1 sailing
1 was
1 glad
1 to
1 dispose
1 of
1 his
1 uniform
1 which
1 consisted
1 of
1 a
1 light
1 brown
1 Norfolk
1 shooting
1 jacket
1 knickerbockers
1 and
1 helmet
1 as
1 these
1 would
1 be
1 of
1 no
1 use
1 to
1 him
1 in
1 England
1 Frank
1 s
1 next
1 step
1 was
1 to
1 go
1 to
1 the
1 agent
1 of
1 Messrs
1 Swanzy
1 the
1 principal
1 African
1 merchants
1 of
1 the
1 coast
1 This
1 gentleman
1 readily
1 cashed
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 orders
1 on
1 the
1 African
1 bank
1 which
1 Mr
1 Goodenough
1 had
1 before
1 his
1 death
1 handed
1 over
1 to
1 Frank
1 and
1 the
1 latter
1 proceeded
1 to
1 discharge
1 the
1 long
1 arrears
1 of
1 wages
1 owing
1 to
1 Ostik
1 adding
1 besides
1 a
1 handsome
1 present
1 He
1 offered
1 to
1 allow
1 his
1 faithful
1 servant
1 to
1 depart
1 to
1 join
1 his
1 family
1 on
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 at
1 once
1 should
1 he
1 wish
1 to
1 do
1 so
1 but
1 Ostik
1 declared
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 remain
1 with
1 him
1 as
1 long
1 as
1 he
1 stopped
1 in
1 Africa
1 On
1 Frank
1 s
1 advice
1 however
1 he
1 deposited
1 his
1 money
1 for
1 safe
1 keeping
1 with
1 Messrs
1 Swanzy
1 s
1 agent
1 with
1 orders
1 to
1 transmit
1 it
1 to
1 his
1 family
1 should
1 anything
1 happen
1 to
1 him
1 during
1 the
1 expedition
1 Three
1 days
1 later
1 Frank
1 was
1 attacked
1 by
1 fever
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 the
1 reaction
1 after
1 so
1 many
1 dangers
1 He
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 sent
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 Simoon
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 established
1 as
1 a
1 hospital
1 ship
1 but
1 the
1 attack
1 was
1 a
1 mild
1 one
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 days
1 thanks
1 to
1 the
1 sea
1 air
1 and
1 the
1 attention
1 and
1 nursing
1 which
1 he
1 received
1 he
1 was
1 convalescent
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 the
1 fever
1 passed
1 away
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 able
1 to
1 sit
1 on
1 deck
1 and
1 enjoy
1 the
1 sea
1 breezes
1 he
1 had
1 many
1 visits
1 from
1 the
1 officers
1 of
1 the
1 ships
1 of
1 war
1 Among
1 these
1 was
1 the
1 captain
1 of
1 the
1 Decoy
1 gunboat
1 After
1 chatting
1 with
1 Frank
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 the
1 officer
1 said
1 I
1 am
1 going
1 down
1 the
1 coast
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 Volta
1 where
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 is
1 organizing
1 another
1 expedition
1 You
1 will
1 not
1 be
1 wanted
1 on
1 shore
1 just
1 at
1 present
1 and
1 a
1 week
1 s
1 rest
1 will
1 do
1 you
1 good
1 what
1 do
1 you
1 say
1 to
1 coming
1 down
1 with
1 me
1 -
1 -it
1 will
1 give
1 you
1 a
1 little
1 change
1 and
1 variety
1 Frank
1 accepted
1 the
1 invitation
1 with
1 pleasure
1 An
1 hour
1 later
1 the
1 Decoy
1 s
1 boat
1 came
1 alongside
1 and
1 Frank
1 took
1 his
1 place
1 on
1 board
1 it
1 Ostik
1 following
1 with
1 his
1 clothes
1 An
1 hour
1 later
1 the
1 Decoy
1 got
1 up
1 her
1 anchor
1 and
1 steamed
1 down
1 the
1 coast
1 It
1 was
1 delightful
1 to
1 Frank
1 sitting
1 in
1 a
1 large
1 wicker
1 work
1 chair
1 in
1 the
1 shade
1 of
1 the
1 awning
1 watching
1 the
1 distant
1 shore
1 and
1 chatting
1 with
1 the
1 officers
1 He
1 had
1 much
1 to
1 hear
1 of
1 what
1 had
1 taken
1 place
1 in
1 England
1 since
1 he
1 left
1 and
1 they
1 on
1 their
1 part
1 were
1 equally
1 eager
1 to
1 learn
1 about
1 the
1 road
1 along
1 which
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 to
1 march
1 -
1 -at
1 least
1 those
1 of
1 them
1 who
1 were
1 fortunate
1 enough
1 to
1 be
1 appointed
1 to
1 the
1 naval
1 brigade
1 -
1 -and
1 the
1 wonders
1 of
1 the
1 barbarian
1 capital
1 The
1 Decoy
1 was
1 not
1 fast
1 about
1 six
1 knots
1 being
1 her
1 average
1 pace
1 of
1 steaming
1 however
1 no
1 one
1 was
1 in
1 a
1 hurry
1 there
1 would
1 be
1 nothing
1 to
1 do
1 until
1 the
1 troops
1 arrived
1 from
1 England
1 and
1 to
1 all
1 a
1 trip
1 down
1 the
1 coast
1 was
1 a
1 pleasant
1 change
1 after
1 the
1 long
1 monotony
1 of
1 rolling
1 at
1 anchor
1 For
1 some
1 distance
1 from
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 the
1 shore
1 was
1 flat
1 but
1 further
1 on
1 the
1 country
1 became
1 hilly
1 Some
1 of
1 the
1 undulations
1 reached
1 a
1 considerable
1 height
1 the
1 highest
1 Mamquady
1 being
1 over
1 two
1 thousand
1 feet
1 That
1 ought
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 very
1 healthy
1 place
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 should
1 think
1 that
1 a
1 sanatorium
1 established
1 there
1 would
1 be
1 an
1 immense
1 boon
1 to
1 the
1 whites
1 all
1 along
1 the
1 coasts
1 One
1 would
1 think
1 so
1 an
1 officer
1 replied
1 but
1 I
1 m
1 told
1 that
1 those
1 hills
1 are
1 particularly
1 unhealthy
1 That
1 fellow
1 you
1 see
1 jutting
1 out
1 is
1 said
1 to
1 be
1 extremely
1 rich
1 in
1 gold
1 Over
1 and
1 over
1 again
1 parties
1 have
1 been
1 formed
1 to
1 dig
1 there
1 but
1 they
1 have
1 always
1 suffered
1 so
1 terribly
1 from
1 fever
1 that
1 they
1 have
1 had
1 to
1 relinquish
1 the
1 attempt
1 The
1 natives
1 suffer
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 the
1 whites
1 I
1 believe
1 that
1 the
1 formation
1 is
1 granite
1 the
1 surface
1 of
1 which
1 is
1 much
1 decomposed
1 and
1 it
1 is
1 always
1 found
1 here
1 that
1 the
1 turning
1 up
1 of
1 ground
1 that
1 has
1 not
1 been
1 disturbed
1 for
1 many
1 years
1 is
1 extremely
1 unhealthy
1 and
1 decomposing
1 granite
1 possesses
1 some
1 element
1 particularly
1 obnoxious
1 to
1 health
1 The
1 natives
1 of
1 course
1 look
1 upon
1 the
1 mountain
1 as
1 a
1 fetish
1 and
1 believe
1 that
1 an
1 evil
1 spirit
1 guards
1 it
1 The
1 superstition
1 of
1 the
1 negroes
1 is
1 wonderful
1 and
1 at
1 Accra
1 they
1 are
1 if
1 possible
1 more
1 superstitious
1 than
1 anywhere
1 else
1 Every
1 one
1 believes
1 that
1 every
1 malady
1 under
1 the
1 sun
1 is
1 produced
1 by
1 fetish
1 and
1 that
1 some
1 enemy
1 is
1 casting
1 spells
1 upon
1 them
1 There
1 is
1 more
1 in
1 it
1 than
1 you
1 think
1 the
1 doctor
1 joined
1 in
1 although
1 it
1 is
1 not
1 spells
1 but
1 poison
1 which
1 they
1 use
1 against
1 each
1 other
1 The
1 use
1 of
1 poison
1 is
1 carried
1 to
1 an
1 incredible
1 extent
1 here
1 I
1 have
1 not
1 been
1 much
1 on
1 shore
1 but
1 the
1 medical
1 men
1 both
1 civilian
1 and
1 military
1 who
1 have
1 been
1 here
1 any
1 time
1 are
1 convinced
1 that
1 a
1 vast
1 number
1 of
1 the
1 deaths
1 that
1 take
1 place
1 are
1 due
1 to
1 poison
1 The
1 fetish
1 men
1 and
1 women
1 who
1 are
1 the
1 vendors
1 of
1 these
1 drugs
1 keep
1 as
1 a
1 profound
1 secret
1 their
1 origin
1 and
1 nature
1 but
1 it
1 is
1 certain
1 that
1 many
1 of
1 them
1 are
1 in
1 point
1 of
1 secrecy
1 and
1 celerity
1 equal
1 to
1 those
1 of
1 the
1 middle
1 ages
1 I
1 wonder
1 that
1 the
1 doctors
1 have
1 never
1 discovered
1 what
1 plants
1 they
1 get
1 them
1 from
1 Frank
1 said
1 Some
1 of
1 them
1 have
1 tried
1 to
1 do
1 so
1 the
1 doctor
1 replied
1 but
1 have
1 invariably
1 died
1 shortly
1 after
1 commencing
1 their
1 experiments
1 it
1 is
1 believed
1 they
1 have
1 been
1 poisoned
1 by
1 the
1 fetish
1 men
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 prevent
1 their
1 secrets
1 being
1 discovered
1 The
1 hours
1 passed
1 pleasurably
1 The
1 beautiful
1 neatness
1 and
1 order
1 prevailing
1 on
1 board
1 a
1 man
1 of
1 war
1 were
1 specially
1 delightful
1 to
1 Frank
1 after
1 the
1 rough
1 life
1 he
1 had
1 so
1 long
1 led
1 and
1 the
1 silence
1 and
1 discipline
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 presented
1 an
1 equally
1 strong
1 contrast
1 to
1 the
1 incessant
1 chattering
1 and
1 noise
1 kept
1 up
1 by
1 the
1 niggers
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 the
1 ship
1 was
1 off
1 Accra
1 Here
1 the
1 scenery
1 had
1 entirely
1 changed
1 The
1 hills
1 had
1 receded
1 and
1 a
1 wide
1 and
1 slightly
1 undulating
1 plain
1 extended
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 some
1 twelve
1 miles
1 back
1 The
1 captain
1 was
1 going
1 to
1 land
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 some
1 despatches
1 for
1 the
1 colony
1 and
1 he
1 invited
1 Frank
1 to
1 accompany
1 him
1 They
1 did
1 not
1 as
1 Frank
1 expected
1 land
1 in
1 a
1 man
1 of
1 war
1 s
1 boat
1 but
1 in
1 a
1 surf
1 boat
1 which
1 upon
1 their
1 hoisting
1 a
1 signal
1 came
1 out
1 to
1 them
1 These
1 surf
1 boats
1 are
1 large
1 and
1 very
1 wide
1 and
1 flat
1 They
1 are
1 paddled
1 by
1 ten
1 or
1 twelve
1 negroes
1 who
1 sit
1 upon
1 the
1 gunwale
1 These
1 men
1 work
1 vigorously
1 and
1 the
1 boats
1 travel
1 at
1 a
1 considerable
1 pace
1 Each
1 boat
1 has
1 a
1 stroke
1 peculiar
1 to
1 itself
1 Some
1 paddle
1 hard
1 for
1 six
1 strokes
1 and
1 then
1 easy
1 for
1 an
1 equal
1 number
1 Some
1 will
1 take
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 hard
1 and
1 then
1 one
1 easy
1 The
1 steersman
1 stands
1 in
1 the
1 stern
1 and
1 steers
1 with
1 an
1 oar
1 He
1 or
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 crew
1 keeps
1 up
1 a
1 monotonous
1 song
1 to
1 which
1 the
1 crew
1 reply
1 in
1 chorus
1 always
1 in
1 time
1 with
1 their
1 paddling
1 The
1 surf
1 is
1 heavy
1 at
1 Accra
1 and
1 Frank
1 held
1 his
1 breath
1 as
1 after
1 waiting
1 for
1 a
1 favorable
1 moment
1 the
1 steersman
1 gave
1 the
1 sign
1 and
1 the
1 boat
1 darted
1 in
1 at
1 lightning
1 speed
1 on
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 a
1 great
1 wave
1 and
1 ran
1 up
1 on
1 the
1 beach
1 in
1 the
1 midst
1 of
1 a
1 whirl
1 of
1 white
1 foam
1 hile
1 the
1 captain
1 went
1 up
1 to
1 Government
1 House
1 Frank
1 accompanied
1 by
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 young
1 officers
1 who
1 had
1 also
1 come
1 ashore
1 took
1 a
1 stroll
1 through
1 the
1 town
1 The
1 first
1 thing
1 that
1 struck
1 him
1 was
1 the
1 extraordinary
1 number
1 of
1 pigs
1 These
1 animals
1 pervaded
1 the
1 whole
1 place
1 They
1 fed
1 in
1 threes
1 and
1 fours
1 in
1 the
1 middle
1 of
1 the
1 streets
1 They
1 lay
1 everywhere
1 in
1 the
1 road
1 across
1 the
1 doors
1 and
1 against
1 the
1 walls
1 They
1 quarreled
1 energetically
1 inside
1 lanes
1 and
1 courtyards
1 and
1 when
1 worsted
1 in
1 their
1 disputes
1 galloped
1 away
1 grunting
1 careless
1 whom
1 they
1 might
1 upset
1 The
1 principal
1 street
1 of
1 Accra
1 was
1 an
1 amusing
1 sight
1 Some
1 effort
1 had
1 been
1 made
1 to
1 keep
1 it
1 free
1 of
1 the
1 filth
1 and
1 rubbish
1 which
1 everywhere
1 else
1 abounded
1 Both
1 sides
1 were
1 lined
1 by
1 salesmen
1 and
1 women
1 sitting
1 on
1 little
1 mats
1 upon
1 the
1 low
1 wooden
1 stools
1 used
1 as
1 seats
1 in
1 Africa
1 The
1 goods
1 were
1 contained
1 in
1 wooden
1 trays
1 Here
1 were
1 dozens
1 of
1 women
1 offering
1 beads
1 for
1 sale
1 of
1 an
1 unlimited
1 variety
1 of
1 form
1 and
1 hue
1 They
1 varied
1 from
1 the
1 tiny
1 opaque
1 beads
1 of
1 all
1 colors
1 used
1 by
1 English
1 children
1 for
1 their
1 dolls
1 to
1 great
1 cylindrical
1 beads
1 of
1 variegated
1 hues
1 as
1 long
1 and
1 as
1 thick
1 as
1 the
1 joint
1 of
1 a
1 finger
1 The
1 love
1 of
1 the
1 Africans
1 for
1 beads
1 is
1 surprising
1 The
1 women
1 wear
1 them
1 round
1 the
1 wrists
1 the
1 neck
1 and
1 the
1 ankles
1 The
1 occupation
1 of
1 threading
1 the
1 little
1 beads
1 is
1 one
1 of
1 their
1 greatest
1 pleasures
1 The
1 threads
1 used
1 are
1 narrow
1 fibers
1 of
1 palm
1 leaves
1 which
1 are
1 very
1 strong
1 The
1 beads
1 however
1 are
1 of
1 unequal
1 sizes
1 and
1 no
1 African
1 girl
1 who
1 has
1 any
1 respect
1 for
1 her
1 personal
1 appearance
1 will
1 put
1 on
1 a
1 string
1 of
1 beads
1 until
1 she
1 has
1 with
1 great
1 pains
1 and
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 of
1 skill
1 rubbed
1 them
1 with
1 sand
1 and
1 water
1 until
1 all
1 the
1 projecting
1 beads
1 are
1 ground
1 down
1 and
1 the
1 whole
1 are
1 perfectly
1 smooth
1 and
1 even
1 Next
1 in
1 number
1 to
1 the
1 dealers
1 in
1 beads
1 were
1 those
1 who
1 sold
1 calico
1 or
1 as
1 it
1 is
1 called
1 in
1 Africa
1 cloth
1 and
1 gaudily
1 colored
1 kerchiefs
1 for

1 These
1 three
1 articles
1 -
1 -beads
1 cotton
1 cloth
1 and
1 colored
1 handkerchiefs
1 -
1 -complete
1 the
1 list
1 of
1 articles
1 required
1 for
1 the
1 attire
1 and
1 adornment
1 of
1 males

1 leaves
1 short
1 clay
1 pipes

1 small
1 looking

1 returned
1 to

1 down

1 The
1 next

1 weighed
1 anchor
1 off
1 Addah
1 a
1 village
1 at
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 Volta
1 They
1 whistled
1 for
1 a
1 surf
1 boat
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 some
1 time
1 before
1 one
1 put
1 out
1 hen
1 she
1 was
1 launched
1 it
1 was
1 doubtful
1 whether
1 she
1 would
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 make
1 her
1 way
1 through
1 the
1 breaking
1 water
1 The
1 surf
1 was
1 much
1 heavier
1 here
1 than
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 at
1 Accra
1 and
1 each
1 wave
1 threw
1 the
1 boat
1 almost
1 perpendicularly
1 into
1 the
1 air
1 so
1 that
1 only
1 a
1 few
1 feet
1 of
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 keel
1 touched
1 the
1 water
1 Still
1 she
1 struggled
1 on
1 although
1 so
1 long
1 was
1 she
1 in
1 getting
1 through
1 the
1 surf
1 that
1 those
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 ship
1 thought
1 several
1 times
1 that
1 she
1 must
1 give
1 it
1 up
1 as
1 impracticable
1 At

1 however
1 she

1 through

1 waited
1 for

1 they
1 had
1 seen
1 of
1 the
1 difficulty
1 which
1 the
1 boat
1 had
1 in
1 getting
1 out
1 all
1 looked
1 somewhat
1 anxiously
1 at
1 the
1 surf
1 as
1 they
1 approached
1 the
1 line
1 where
1 the
1 great
1 smooth
1 waves
1 rolled
1 over
1 and
1 broke
1 into
1 boiling
1 foam
1 The
1 steersman
1 stood
1 upon
1 the
1 seat
1 in
1 the
1 stern
1 in
1 one
1 hand
1 holding
1 his
1 oar
1 in
1 the
1 other
1 his
1 cap
1 For
1 some
1 time
1 he
1 stood
1 half
1 turned
1 round
1 looking
1 attentively
1 seaward
1 while
1 the
1 boat
1 lay
1 at
1 rest
1 just
1 outside
1 the
1 line
1 of
1 breakers
1 Suddenly
1 he
1 waved
1 his
1 cap
1 and
1 gave
1 a
1 shout
1 It
1 was
1 answered
1 by
1 the
1 crew
1 Every
1 man
1 dashed
1 his
1 paddle
1 into
1 the
1 water
1 Desperately
1 they
1 rowed
1 the
1 steersman
1 encouraging
1 them
1 by
1 wild
1 yells
1 A
1 gigantic
1 wave
1 rolled
1 in
1 behind
1 the
1 boat
1 and
1 looked
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 as
1 if
1 she
1 would
1 break
1 into
1 it
1 but
1 she
1 rose
1 on
1 it
1 just
1 as
1 it
1 turned
1 over
1 and
1 for
1 an
1 instant
1 was
1 swept
1 along
1 amidst
1 a
1 cataract
1 of
1 white
1 foam
1 with
1 the
1 speed
1 of
1 an
1 arrow
1 The
1 next
1 wave
1 was
1 a
1 small
1 one
1 and
1 ere
1 a
1 third
1 reached
1 it
1 the
1 boat
1 grounded
1 on
1 the
1 sand
1 A
1 dozen
1 men
1 rushed
1 out
1 into
1 the
1 water
1 The
1 passengers
1 threw
1 themselves
1 anyhow
1 on
1 to
1 their
1 backs
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 minute
1 were
1 standing
1 perfectly
1 dry
1 upon
1 the
1 beach
1 They
1 learned
1 that
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 s
1 camp
1 was
1 half
1 a
1 mile
1 distant
1 and
1 at
1 once
1 set
1 out
1 for
1 it
1 Upon
1 the
1 way
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 they
1 passed
1 hundreds
1 of
1 negroes
1 who
1 had
1 arrived
1 in
1 the
1 last
1 day
1 or
1 two
1 and
1 had
1 just
1 received
1 their
1 arms
1 Some
1 were
1 squatted
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 cooking
1 and
1 resting
1 themselves
1 Others
1 were
1 examining
1 their
1 new
1 weapons
1 oiling
1 and
1 removing
1 every
1 spot
1 of
1 rust
1 and
1 occasionally
1 loading
1 and
1 firing
1 them
1 off
1 The
1 balls
1 whizzed
1 through
1 the
1 air
1 in
1 all
1 directions
1 The
1 most
1 stringent
1 orders
1 had
1 been
1 given
1 forbidding
1 this
1 dangerous
1 nuisance
1 but
1 nothing
1 can
1 repress
1 the
1 love
1 of
1 negroes
1 for
1 firing
1 off
1 guns
1 There
1 were
1 large
1 numbers
1 of
1 women
1 among
1 them
1 these
1 had
1 acted
1 as
1 carriers
1 on
1 their
1 journey
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 for
1 among
1 the
1 coast
1 tribes
1 as
1 among
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 it
1 is
1 the
1 proper
1 thing
1 when
1 the
1 warriors
1 go
1 out
1 on
1 the
1 warpath
1 that
1 the
1 women
1 should
1 not
1 permit
1 them
1 to
1 carry
1 anything
1 except
1 their
1 guns
1 until
1 they
1 approach
1 the
1 neighborhood
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 The
1 party
1 soon
1 arrived
1 at
1 the
1 camp
1 which
1 consisted
1 of
1 some
1 bell
1 tents
1 and
1 the
1 little
1 huts
1 of
1 a
1 few
1 hundred
1 natives
1 This
1 indeed
1 was
1 only
1 the
1 place
1 where
1 the
1 latter
1 were
1 first
1 received
1 and
1 armed
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 then
1 sent
1 up
1 the
1 river
1 in
1 the
1 steamboat
1 belonging
1 to
1 the
1 expedition
1 to
1 the
1 great
1 camp
1 some
1 thirty
1 miles
1 higher
1 The
1 expedition
1 consisted
1 only
1 of
1 some
1 seven
1 or
1 eight
1 English
1 officers
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 of
1 the
1 royal
1 navy
1 was
1 in
1 command
1 with
1 Mr
1 Goldsworthy
1 and
1 Captain
1 Sartorius
1 as
1 his
1 assistants
1 There
1 were
1 four
1 other
1 officers
1 two
1 doctors
1 and
1 an
1 officer
1 of
1 commissariat
1 This
1 little
1 body
1 had
1 the
1 whole
1 work
1 of
1 drilling
1 and
1 keeping
1 in
1 order
1 some
1 eight
1 or
1 ten
1 thousand
1 men
1 They
1 were
1 generals
1 colonels
1 sergeants
1 quartermasters
1 storekeepers
1 and
1 diplomatists
1 all
1 at
1 once
1 and
1 from
1 daybreak
1 until
1 late
1 at
1 night
1 were
1 incessantly
1 at
1 work
1 There
1 were
1 at
1 least
1 a
1 dozen
1 petty
1 kings
1 in
1 camp
1 all
1 of
1 whom
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 kept
1 in
1 a
1 good
1 temper
1 and
1 this
1 was
1 by
1 no
1 means
1 the
1 smallest
1 of
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 s
1 difficulties
1 as
1 upon
1 the
1 slightest
1 ground
1 for
1 discontent
1 each
1 of
1 these
1 was
1 ready
1 at
1 once
1 to
1 march
1 away
1 with
1 his
1 followers
1 The
1 most
1 reliable
1 portion
1 of
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 s
1 force
1 were
1 some
1 2
1 5
1 0
1 Houssas
1 and
1 as
1 many
1 Yorabas
1 In
1 addition
1 to
1 all
1 their
1 work
1 with
1 the
1 native
1 allies
1 the
1 officers
1 of
1 the
1 expedition
1 had
1 succeeded
1 in
1 drilling
1 both
1 these
1 bodies
1 until
1 they
1 had
1 obtained
1 a
1 very
1 fair
1 amount
1 of
1 discipline
1 After
1 strolling
1 through
1 the
1 camp
1 the
1 visitors
1 went
1 to
1 look
1 on
1 at
1 the
1 distribution
1 of
1 arms
1 and
1 accouterments
1 to
1 a
1 hundred
1 freshly
1 arrived
1 natives
1 They
1 were
1 served
1 out
1 with
1 blue
1 smocks
1 made
1 of
1 serge
1 and
1 blue
1 nightcaps
1 which
1 had
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 transforming
1 a
1 fine
1 looking
1 body
1 of
1 natives
1 upright
1 in
1 carriage
1 and
1 graceful
1 in
1 their
1 toga
1 -like
1 attire
1 into
1 a
1 set
1 of
1 awkward
1 looking
1 clumsy
1 negroes
1 A
1 haversack
1 water
1 bottle
1 belts
1 cap
1 pouch
1 and
1 ammunition
1 pouch
1 were
1 also
1 handed
1 to
1 each
1 to
1 their
1 utter
1 bewilderment
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 easy
1 to
1 foresee
1 that
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 the
1 first
1 day
1 s
1 march
1 the
1 whole
1 of
1 these
1 to
1 them
1 utterly
1 useless
1 articles
1 would
1 be
1 thrown
1 aside
1 They
1 brightened
1 up
1 however
1 when
1 the
1 guns
1 were
1 delivered
1 to
1 them
1 The
1 first
1 impulse
1 of
1 each
1 was
1 to
1 examine
1 his
1 piece
1 carefully
1 to
1 try
1 its
1 balance
1 by
1 taking
1 aim
1 at
1 distant
1 objects
1 then
1 to
1 carefully
1 rub
1 off
1 any
1 little
1 spot
1 of
1 rust
1 that
1 could
1 be
1 detected
1 lastly
1 to
1 take
1 out
1 the
1 ramrod
1 and
1 let
1 it
1 fall
1 into
1 the
1 barrel
1 to
1 judge
1 by
1 the
1 ring
1 whether
1 it
1 was
1 clean
1 inside
1 Thence
1 the
1 visitors
1 strolled
1 away
1 to
1 watch
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 Houssas
1 in
1 hot
1 pursuit
1 of
1 some
1 bullocks
1 which
1 were
1 to
1 be
1 put
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 steamers
1 and
1 taken
1 up
1 the
1 river
1 to
1 the
1 great
1 camp
1 These
1 had
1 broken
1 loose
1 in
1 the
1 night
1 and
1 the
1 chase
1 was
1 an
1 exciting
1 one
1 Although
1 some
1 fifty
1 or
1 sixty
1 men
1 were
1 engaged
1 in
1 the
1 hunt
1 it
1 took
1 no
1 less
1 than
1 four
1 hours
1 to
1 capture
1 the
1 requisite
1 number
1 and
1 seven
1 Houssas
1 were
1 more
1 or
1 less
1 injured
1 by
1 the
1 charges
1 of
1 the
1 desperate
1 little
1 animals
1 which
1 possessed
1 wonderful
1 strength
1 and
1 endurance
1 although
1 no
1 larger
1 than
1 moderate
1 sized
1 donkeys
1 They
1 were
1 only
1 captured
1 at
1 last
1 by
1 hoops
1 being
1 thrown
1 over
1 their
1 horns
1 and
1 even
1 when
1 thrown
1 down
1 required
1 the
1 efforts
1 of
1 five
1 or
1 six
1 men
1 to
1 tie
1 them
1 They
1 were
1 finally
1 got
1 to
1 the
1 wharf
1 by
1 two
1 men
1 each
1 one
1 went
1 ahead
1 with
1 the
1 rope
1 attached
1 to
1 the
1 animal
1 s
1 horn
1 the
1 other
1 kept
1 behind
1 holding
1 a
1 rope
1 fastened
1 to
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 hind
1 legs
1 Every
1 bull
1 made
1 the
1 most
1 determined
1 efforts
1 to
1 get
1 at
1 the
1 man
1 in
1 front
1 who
1 kept
1 on
1 at
1 a
1 run
1 the
1 animal
1 being
1 checked
1 when
1 it
1 got
1 too
1 close
1 by
1 the
1 man
1 behind
1 pulling
1 at
1 its
1 hind
1 leg
1 hen
1 it
1 turned
1 to
1 attack
1 him
1 the
1 man
1 in
1 front
1 again
1 pulled
1 at
1 his
1 rope
1 So
1 most
1 of
1 them
1 were
1 brought
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 landing
1 place
1 and
1 there
1 with
1 great
1 difficulty
1 again
1 thrown
1 down
1 tied
1 and
1 carried
1 bodily
1 on
1 board
1 Some
1 of
1 them
1 were
1 so
1 unmanageable
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 carried
1 all
1 the
1 way
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 landing
1 place
1 If
1 English
1 cattle
1 possessed
1 the
1 strength
1 and
1 obstinate
1 fury
1 of
1 these
1 little
1 animals
1 Copenhagen
1 Fields
1 would
1 have
1 to
1 be
1 removed
1 farther
1 from
1 London
1 or
1 the
1 entrance
1 swept
1 by
1 machine
1 guns
1 for
1 a
1 charge
1 of
1 the
1 cattle
1 would
1 clear
1 the
1 streets
1 of
1 London
1 After
1 spending
1 an
1 amusing
1 day
1 on
1 shore
1 the
1 party
1 returned
1 on
1 board
1 ship
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 s
1 expedition
1 although
1 composed
1 of
1 only
1 seven
1 or
1 eight
1 English
1 officers
1 and
1 costing
1 the
1 country
1 comparatively
1 nothing
1 accomplished
1 great
1 things
1 but
1 its
1 doings
1 were
1 almost
1 ignored
1 by
1 England
1 Crossing
1 the
1 river
1 they
1 completely
1 defeated
1 the
1 native
1 tribes
1 there
1 who
1 were
1 in
1 alliance
1 with
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 after
1 some
1 hard
1 fighting
1 and
1 thus
1 prevented
1 an
1 invasion
1 of
1 our
1 territory
1 on
1 that
1 side
1 In
1 addition
1 to
1 this
1 they
1 pushed
1 forward
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 and
1 absolutely
1 arrived
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 two
1 days
1 after
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 It
1 is
1 true
1 that
1 the
1 attention
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 was
1 so
1 much
1 occupied
1 by
1 the
1 advance
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 force
1 that
1 they
1 paid
1 but
1 little
1 attention
1 to
1 that
1 advancing
1 from
1 the
1 Volta
1 but
1 none
1 the
1 less
1 is
1 the
1 credit
1 due
1 to
1 the
1 indomitable
1 perseverance
1 and
1 the
1 immensity
1 of
1 the
1 work
1 accomplished
1 by
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 and
1 his
1 officers
1 Alone
1 and
1 single
1 handed
1 they
1 overcame
1 all
1 the
1 enormous
1 difficulties
1 raised
1 by
1 the
1 apathy
1 indolence
1 and
1 self
1 importance
1 of
1 the
1 numerous
1 petty
1 chiefs
1 whose
1 followers
1 constituted
1 the
1 army
1 infused
1 something
1 of
1 their
1 own
1 spirit
1 among
1 their
1 followers
1 and
1 persuaded
1 them
1 to
1 march
1 without
1 white
1 allies
1 against
1 the
1 hitherto
1 invincible
1 army
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 Not
1 a
1 tithe
1 of
1 the
1 credit
1 due
1 to
1 them
1 has
1 been
1 given
1 to
1 the
1 officers
1 of
1 this
1 little
1 force
1 Captain
1 Glover
1 invited
1 his
1 visitors
1 to
1 pass
1 the
1 night
1 on
1 shore
1 offering
1 to
1 place
1 a
1 tent
1 at
1 their
1 disposal
1 but
1 the
1 mosquitoes
1 are
1 so
1 numerous
1 and
1 troublesome
1 along
1 the
1 swampy
1 shore
1 of
1 the
1 Volta
1 that
1 the
1 invitations
1 were
1 declined
1 and
1 the

1 returned
1 on
1 board
1 the
1 Decoy
1 Next
1 day
1 the
1 anchor
1 was
1 hove
1 and
1 the
1 ship
1 s
1 head
1 turned
1 to
1 the

1 and
1 two
1 days
1 later
1 after
1 a
1 pleasant
1 and
1 uneventful
1 voyage
1 she
1 was
1 again
1 off
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 and
1 Frank
1 taking
1 leave
1 of

1 returned

1 to
1 perform
1 any
1 duty
1 that
1 might
1 be
1 assigned
1 to
1 him
1 Until
1 the
1 force
1 advanced
1 he
1 had
1 nothing
1 to
1 do
1 and
1 spent
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 of
1 his
1 time
1 watching
1 the
1 carriers
1 starting
1 with
1 provisions
1 for
1 the
1 Prah
1 and
1 the
1 doings
1 of
1 the
1 negroes
1 The
1 order
1 had
1 now
1 been
1 passed
1 by
1 the
1 chiefs
1 at
1 a
1 meeting
1 called
1 by
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 that
1 every
1 able
1 bodied
1 man
1 should
1 work
1 as
1 a

1 and
1 while

1 of

1 were
1 sent
1 to
1 the
1 villages
1 round
1 to
1 fetch
1 in
1 people
1 thence
1 hunts
1 took
1 place
1 in
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 itself
1 Every
1 negro
1 found
1 in
1 the
1 streets
1 was
1 seized
1 by
1 the
1 police
1 protestation
1 indignation
1 and
1 resistance
1 were
1 equally
1 in
1 vain
1 An
1 arm
1 or
1 the
1 loin
1 cloth
1 was
1 firmly
1 griped
1 and
1 the
1 victim
1 was
1 run
1 into
1 the
1 castle

1 amid
1 the
1 laughter
1 of

1 who
1 consisted
1 after
1 the
1 first
1 quarter
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 of

1 the
1 search
1 began

1 the

1 upon

1 These

1 often
1 indulging

1 dance
1 and

1 After

1 hundred
1 boys
1 and

1 of

1 weighing
1 from
1 twenty
1 -five
1 to
1 thirty
1 -five
1 pounds
1 These
1 small
1 kegs
1 had
1 upon
1 their
1 first
1 arrival
1 been
1 a
1 cause
1 of
1 great
1 bewilderment
1 and
1 annoyance
1 to
1 the
1 commissariat
1 officers
1 for
1 no
1 man
1 or
1 woman
1 unless
1 by
1 profession
1 a
1 juggler
1 could
1 balance
1 two
1 long
1 narrow
1 barrels
1 on
1 the
1 head
1 At
1 last
1 the
1 happy
1 idea
1 struck
1 an
1 officer
1 of
1 the
1 department
1 that
1 the
1 children
1 of
1 the
1 place
1 might
1 be
1 utilized
1 for
1 the
1 purpose
1 No
1 sooner
1 was
1 it
1 known
1 that
1 boys
1 and
1 girls
1 could
1 get
1 half
1 men
1 s
1 wages
1 for
1 carrying
1 up
1 light
1 loads
1 than
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 perfect
1 rush
1 of
1 the
1 juvenile
1 population
1 Three
1 hundred
1 applied
1 the
1 first
1 morning
1 four
1 hundred
1 the
1 next
1 The
1 glee
1 of
1 the
1 youngsters
1 was
1 quite
1 exuberant
1 All
1 were
1 accustomed
1 to
1 carry
1 weights
1 such
1 as
1 great
1 jars
1 of
1 water
1 and
1 baskets
1 of
1 yams
1 far
1 heavier
1 than

1 they
1 were
1 now
1 called

1 of
1 earning

1 and

1 them
1 immensely
1 Bullocks
1 were
1 now
1 arriving
1 from

1 and
1 although
1 these
1 would
1 not
1 live
1 for
1 any
1 time
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 it
1 was
1 thought
1 they
1 would
1 do
1 so
1 long
1 enough
1 to
1 afford
1 the
1 expedition
1 a
1 certain
1 quantity
1 of
1 fresh
1 meat
1 Australian
1 meat
1 and
1 salt
1 pork
1 though
1 valuable

1 weeks
1 after

1 by
1 seven
1 thousand
1 fresh
1 troops
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 sent
1 by
1 the
1 king
1 with
1 orders

1 twenty
1 thousand

1 positively
1 refused

1 until
1 they
1 had

1 and

1 so
1 checked

1 marched
1 through

1 This

1 Not

1 Butterflies
1 were

1 darted
1 along
1 like

1 of

1 The

1 had
1 the
1 advantage
1 of
1 being
1 shady
1 and
1 cool
1 but
1 the
1 heavy
1 rain
1 and

1 had
1 made

1 everywhere
1 slippery
1 and
1 in

1 inches

1 while
1 all
1 the
1 efforts
1 of
1 the

1 and

1 had
1 failed
1 to

1 It
1 was
1 a
1 relief
1 to
1 the
1 party
1 when
1 they
1 emerged
1 from
1 the
1 forests
1 into
1 the

1 clearings
1 where

1 had

1 stood
1 for

1 -not
1 a
1 slow
1 dreamy
1 cooing
1 like

1 but
1 a

1 note
1 repeated
1 in

1 -
1 -alone
1 broke
1 the

1 The

1 and
1 the

1 was
1 not

1 by
1 the

1 and

1 the

1 of

1 became
1 much

1 unpleasant
1 for

1 they
1 passed
1 the

1 of

1 between

1 and

1 In

1 the

1 camp
1 of

1 for

1 and
1 hence
1 to

1 large
1 numbers
1 of
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 dropped
1 by

1 or
1 had
1 crawled
1 into
1 the
1 forest
1 to
1 die
1 smitten
1 by
1 disease
1 or
1 rifle
1 balls
1 There
1 was
1 a
1 general
1 feeling
1 of
1 pleasure
1 as
1 the
1 party
1 emerged
1 from
1 the
1 forest
1 into
1 the
1 large
1 open
1 camp
1 at
1 Prahsue
1 This
1 clearing
1 was
1 twenty
1 acres
1 in
1 extent
1 and
1 occupied
1 an
1 isthmus
1 formed
1 by
1 a
1 loop
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 The
1 2d
1 est
1 Indians
1 were
1 encamped
1 here
1 and
1 huts
1 had
1 been
1 erected
1 under
1 the
1 shade
1 of
1 some
1 lofty
1 trees
1 for
1 the
1 naval
1 brigade
1 In
1 the
1 center
1 was
1 a
1 great
1 square
1 On
1 one
1 side
1 were
1 the
1 range
1 of
1 huts
1 for
1 the
1 general
1 and

1 Two
1 sides
1 of

1 were
1 formed
1 by

1 for

1 and

1 wide
1 ran
1 round
1 three
1 sides
1 of
1 the
1 camp
1 thirty
1 feet
1 below
1 its
1 level
1 The
1 work
1 which
1 the
1 engineers
1 had
1 accomplished
1 was
1 little
1 less
1 than
1 marvelous
1 Eighty
1 miles
1 of
1 road
1 had
1 been
1 cut
1 and
1 cleared
1 every
1 stream
1 however
1 insignificant
1 had
1 been
1 bridged
1 and
1 attempts
1 made
1 to
1 corduroy
1 every
1 swamp
1 This
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 no
1 great
1 feat
1 through
1 a
1 soft
1 wood
1 forest
1 with
1 the
1 aid
1 of
1 good
1 workmen
1 Here
1 however
1 the
1 trees
1 were
1 for
1 the
1 most
1 part
1 of
1 extremely
1 hard
1 wood
1 teak
1 and
1 mahogany
1 forming
1 the
1 majority
1 The
1 natives
1 had
1 no
1 idea
1 of
1 using
1 an
1 axe
1 Their
1 only
1 notion
1 of
1 felling
1 a
1 tree
1 was
1 to
1 squat
1 down
1 beside
1 it
1 and
1 give
1 it
1 little
1 hacking
1 chops
1 with
1 a
1 large
1 knife
1 or
1 a
1 sabre
1 ith
1 such
1 means
1 and
1 such
1 men
1 as
1 these

1 mere
1 work
1 of
1 cutting
1 and
1 making
1 the
1 roads
1 and
1 bridging
1 the
1 streams
1 was
1 enormous
1 But
1 not
1 only
1 was
1 this
1 done
1 but
1 the
1 stations
1 were
1 all
1 stockaded
1 and
1 huts
1 erected
1 for
1 the
1 reception
1 of
1 four

1 the

1 and
1 to
1 him
1 more
1 than
1 any
1 other
1 man
1 was
1 the
1 expedition
1 indebted
1 for
1 its

1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 with
1 his
1 staff
1 among
1 whom
1 Frank
1 was
1 now
1 reckoned
1 reached
1 the
1 Prah
1 During
1 the
1 eight
1 days
1 which
1 elapsed
1 before
1 the
1 white
1 troops
1 came
1 up
1 Frank
1 found
1 much
1 to
1 amuse
1 him
1 The
1 engineers
1 were
1 at
1 work
1 aided
1 by
1 the
1 sailors
1 of
1 the
1 naval
1 brigade
1 which
1 arrived
1 two
1 days
1 after
1 the
1 general
1 in
1 erecting
1 a
1 bridge
1 across
1 the
1 Prah
1 The
1 sailors
1 worked
1 stripped
1 to
1 the
1 waist
1 in
1 the
1 muddy
1 water
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 which
1 was
1 about
1 seven
1 feet
1 deep
1 in
1 the
1 middle
1 hen
1 tired
1 of
1 watching
1 these
1 he
1 would
1 wander
1 into
1 the
1 camp
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 regiments
1 and
1 chat
1 with
1 the
1 men
1 whose
1 astonishment
1 at
1 finding
1 a
1 young
1 Englishman
1 able
1 to
1 converse
1 in
1 their
1 language
1 for
1 the
1 Fanti
1 and
1 Ashanti
1 dialects
1 differ
1 but
1 little
1 was
1 unbounded
1 Sometimes
1 he
1 would
1 be
1 sent
1 for
1 to
1 headquarters
1 to
1 translate
1 to
1 Captain
1 Buller
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 intelligence
1 department
1 the
1 statements
1 of
1 prisoners
1 brought
1 in
1 by
1 the
1 scouts
1 who
1 under
1 Lord
1 Gifford
1 had
1 penetrated
1 many
1 miles
1 beyond
1 the
1 Prah
1 Everywhere
1 these
1 found
1 dead
1 bodies
1 by
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 road
1 showing
1 the
1 state
1 to
1 which
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 army
1 was
1 reduced
1 in
1 its
1 retreat
1 The
1 prisoners
1 brought
1 in
1 were
1 unanimous
1 in
1 saying
1 that
1 great
1 uneasiness
1 had
1 been
1 produced
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 by
1 the
1 news
1 of
1 the
1 advance
1 of
1 the
1 British
1 to
1 the
1 Prah
1 The
1 king
1 had
1 written
1 to
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 severely
1 blaming
1 him
1 for
1 his
1 conduct
1 of
1 the
1 campaign
1 and
1 for
1 the
1 great
1 loss
1 of
1 life
1 among
1 his
1 army
1 All
1 sorts
1 of
1 portents
1 were
1 happening
1 at
1 Coomassie
1 to
1 the
1 great
1 disturbance
1 of
1 the
1 mind
1 of
1 the
1 people
1 Some
1 of
1 those
1 related
1 singularly
1 resembled
1 those
1 said
1 to
1 have
1 occurred
1 before
1 the
1 capture
1 of
1 Rome
1 by
1 the
1 Goths
1 An
1 aerolite
1 had
1 fallen
1 in
1 the
1 marketplace
1 of
1 Coomassie
1 and
1 still
1 more
1 strange
1 a
1 child
1 was
1 born
1 which
1 was
1 at
1 once
1 able
1 to
1 converse
1 fluently
1 This
1 youthful
1 prodigy
1 was
1 placed
1 in
1 a
1 room
1 by
1 itself
1 with
1 guards
1 around
1 it
1 to
1 prevent
1 anyone
1 having
1 converse
1 with
1 the
1 supernatural
1 visitant
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 however
1 it
1 was
1 gone
1 and
1 in
1 its
1 place
1 was
1 found
1 a
1 bundle
1 of
1 dead
1 leaves
1 The
1 fetish
1 men
1 having
1 been
1 consulted
1 declared
1 that
1 this
1 signified
1 that
1 Coomassie
1 itself
1 would
1 disappear
1 and
1 would
1 become
1 nothing
1 but
1 a
1 bundle
1 of
1 dead
1 leaves
1 This
1 had
1 greatly
1 exercised
1 the
1 credulous
1 there
1 Two
1 days
1 after
1 his
1 arrival
1 Frank
1 went
1 down
1 at
1 sunset
1 to
1 bathe
1 in
1 the
1 river
1 He
1 had
1 just
1 reached
1 the
1 bank
1 when
1 he
1 heard
1 a
1 cry
1 among
1 some
1 white
1 soldiers
1 bathing
1 there
1 and
1 was
1 just
1 in
1 time
1 to
1 see
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 pulled
1 under
1 water
1 by
1 an
1 alligator
1 which
1 had
1 seized
1 him
1 by
1 the
1 leg
1 Frank
1 had
1 so
1 often
1 heard
1 what
1 was
1 the
1 best
1 thing
1 to
1 do
1 that
1 he
1 at
1 once
1 threw
1 off
1 his
1 Norfolk
1 jacket
1 plunged
1 into
1 the
1 stream
1 and
1 swam
1 to
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 the
1 eddy
1 on
1 the
1 surface
1 showed
1 that
1 a
1 struggle
1 was
1 going
1 on
1 beneath
1 The
1 water
1 was
1 too
1 muddy
1 to
1 see
1 far
1 through
1 it
1 but
1 Frank
1 speedily
1 came
1 upon
1 the
1 alligator
1 and
1 finding
1 its
1 eyes
1 shoved
1 his
1 thumbs
1 into
1 them
1 In
1 an
1 instant
1 the
1 creature
1 relaxed
1 his
1 hold
1 of
1 his
1 prey
1 and
1 made
1 off
1 and
1 Frank
1 seizing
1 the
1 wounded
1 man
1 swam
1 with
1 him
1 to
1 shore
1 amid
1 the
1 loud
1 cheers
1 of
1 the
1 sailors
1 The
1 soldier
1 who
1 proved
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 marine
1 was
1 insensible
1 and
1 his
1 leg
1 was
1 nearly
1 severed
1 above
1 the
1 ankle
1 He
1 soon
1 recovered
1 consciousness
1 and
1 being
1 carried
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 his
1 leg
1 was
1 amputated
1 below
1 the
1 knee
1 and
1 he
1 was
1 soon
1 afterwards
1 taken
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 It
1 had
1 been
1 known
1 that
1 there
1 were
1 alligators
1 in
1 the
1 river
1 a
1 young
1 one
1 about
1 a
1 yard
1 long
1 having
1 been
1 captured
1 and
1 tied
1 up
1 like
1 a
1 dog
1 in
1 the
1 camp
1 with
1 a
1 string
1 round
1 its
1 neck
1 But
1 it
1 was
1 thought
1 that
1 the
1 noise
1 of
1 building
1 the
1 bridge
1 and
1 the
1 movement
1 on
1 the
1 banks
1 would
1 have
1 driven
1 them
1 away
1 After
1 this
1 incident
1 bathing
1 was
1 for
1 the
1 most
1 part
1 abandoned
1 The
1 affair
1 made
1 Frank
1 a
1 great
1 favorite
1 in
1 the
1 naval
1 brigade
1 and
1 of
1 a
1 night
1 he
1 would
1 after
1 dinner
1 generally
1 repair
1 there
1 and
1 sit
1 by
1 the
1 great
1 bonfires
1 which
1 the
1 tars
1 kept
1 up
1 and
1 listen
1 to
1 the
1 jovial
1 choruses
1 which
1 they
1 raised
1 around
1 them
1 Two
1 days
1 after
1 the
1 arrival
1 of
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 an
1 ambassador
1 came
1 down
1 from
1 the
1 king
1 with
1 a
1 letter
1 inquiring
1 indignantly
1 why
1 the
1 English
1 had
1 attacked
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 troops
1 and
1 why
1 they
1 had
1 advanced
1 to
1 the
1 Prah
1 An
1 opportunity
1 was
1 taken
1 to
1 impress
1 him
1 with
1 the
1 nature
1 of
1 the
1 English
1 arms
1 A
1 Gatling
1 gun
1 was
1 placed
1 on
1 the
1 river
1 bank
1 and
1 its
1 fire
1 directed
1 upon
1 the
1 surface
1 and
1 the
1 fountain
1 of
1 water
1 which
1 rose
1 as
1 the
1 steady
1 stream
1 of
1 bullets
1 struck
1 its
1 surface
1 astonished
1 and
1 evidently
1 filled
1 with
1 awe
1 the
1 Ashanti
1 ambassador
1 On
1 the
1 following
1 day
1 this
1 emissary
1 took
1 his
1 departure
1 for
1 Coomassie
1 with
1 a
1 letter
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 On
1 the
1 1
1 2th
1 the
1 messengers
1 returned
1 with
1 an
1 unsatisfactory
1 answer
1 to
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 s
1 letter
1 they
1 brought
1 with
1 them
1 Mr
1 Kuhne
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 German
1 missionaries
1 He
1 said
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 reported
1 in
1 Coomassie
1 that
1 twenty
1 thousand
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 forty
1 thousand
1 Ashantis
1 who
1 had
1 crossed
1 the
1 Prah
1 had
1 died
1 It
1 is
1 probable
1 that
1 this
1 was
1 exaggerated
1 but
1 Mr
1 Kuhne
1 had
1 counted
1 two
1 hundred
1 and
1 seventy
1 -six
1 men
1 carrying
1 boxes
1 containing
1 the
1 bones
1 of
1 chiefs
1 and
1 leading
1 men
1 As
1 these
1 would
1 have
1 fared
1 better
1 than
1 the
1 common
1 herd
1 they
1 would
1 have

1 The

1 under

1 sprang
1 up
1 and
1 the

1 tree
1 was
1 levelled
1 to

1 This
1 caused

1 sensation
1 in

1 which
1 was
1 heightened
1 when

1 s
1 letter
1 arrived
1 and

1 to

1 dated
1 upon

1 the

1 a

1 forward
1 with

1 and
1 shouted
1 to

1 to
1 go
1 back
1 for
1 that

1 and
1 then
1 made
1 a
1 rush
1 with

1 for
1 the

1 It
1 was
1 found
1 deserted
1 the
1 priest
1 and
1 his
1 followers
1 having
1 fled
1 hastily
1 when
1 they
1 found
1 that
1 neither

1 nor
1 the

1 force
1 availed
1 to
1 prevent
1 the
1 British
1 from

1 hundred
1 feet

1 inhabited
1 by

1 These
1 people
1 however
1 were
1 so
1 harassed
1 by
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 forced
1 to
1 abandon
1 their
1 country
1 and
1 settle
1 in

1 protectorate
1 south
1 of

1 the

1 would
1 have
1 been
1 extremely
1 strong
1 A
1 hill
1 if
1 clear
1 of

1 is
1 of
1 immense
1 advantage
1 to
1 men
1 armed
1 with

1 and
1 supported
1 by
1 artillery
1 but
1 to
1 men
1 armed
1 only
1 with
1 guns
1 carrying
1 slugs
1 a
1 distance
1 of
1 fifty
1 yards
1 the
1 advantage
1 is
1 not
1 marked
1 especially
1 when
1 as
1 is
1 the
1 case
1 with
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 they
1 always
1 fire
1 high
1 The
1 crest
1 of
1 the
1 hill
1 was
1 very
1 narrow
1 indeed
1 a

1 with

1 yards
1 only
1 of

1 ground
1 between
1 the
1 steep
1 descents
1 on

1 side
1 From
1 this
1 point
1 the
1 scouts
1 perceived
1 the
1 first
1 town
1 in
1 the
1 territory
1 of
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Adansee
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 five
1 great
1 kings
1 of

1 The
1 scouts
1 and
1 Russell
1 s
1 regiment
1 halted
1 on
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 the
1 hill
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 morning
1 the
1 scouts
1 went
1 out
1 skirmishing
1 towards
1 Queesa
1 The
1 war
1 drum
1 could
1 be
1 heard
1 beating
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 but
1 no
1 opposition
1 was
1 offered
1 It
1 was
1 not
1 however
1 considered
1 prudent
1 to
1 push
1 beyond
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 hill
1 until
1 more
1 troops
1 came
1 up
1 The
1 scouts
1 therefore
1 contented
1 themselves
1 with
1 keeping
1 guard
1 while
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 four
1 days
1 Russell
1 s
1 men
1 and
1 the
1 engineers
1 labored
1 incessantly
1 as
1 they
1 had
1 done
1 all
1 the
1 way
1 from
1 the
1 Prah
1 in
1 making
1 the
1 road
1 over
1 the
1 hill
1 practicable
1 During
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 scouts
1 often
1 pushed
1 up
1 close
1 to
1 Queesa
1 and
1 reported
1 that
1 the
1 soldiers
1 and
1 population
1 were
1 fast
1 deserting
1 the
1 town
1 On
1 the
1 fifth
1 day
1 it
1 was
1 found
1 to
1 be
1 totally
1 deserted
1 and
1 Major
1 Russell
1 moved
1 the
1 headquarters
1 of
1 his
1 regiment
1 down
1 into
1 it
1 The
1 white
1 officers
1 were
1 much
1 surprised
1 with
1 the
1 structure
1 of
1 the
1 huts
1 of
1 this
1 place
1 which
1 was
1 exactly
1 similar
1 to
1 that
1 of
1 those
1 of
1 Coomassie
1 with
1 their
1 red
1 clay
1 their
1 alcoved
1 bed
1 places
1 and
1 their
1 little
1 courts
1 one
1 behind
1 the
1 other
1 Major
1 Russell
1 established
1 himself
1 in
1 the
1 chief
1 s
1 palace
1 which
1 was
1 exactly
1 like
1 the
1 other
1 houses
1 except
1 that
1 the
1 alcoves
1 were
1 very
1 lofty
1 and
1 their
1 roofs
1 supported
1 by
1 pillars
1 These
1 with
1 their
1 red
1 paint
1 their
1 arabesque
1 adornments
1 and
1 their
1 quaint
1 character
1 gave
1 the
1 courtyard
1 the
1 precise
1 appearance
1 of
1 an
1 Egyptian
1 temple
1 The
1 question
1 whether
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 would
1 or
1 would
1 not
1 fight
1 was
1 still
1 eagerly
1 debated
1 Upon
1 the
1 one
1 hand
1 it
1 was
1 urged
1 that
1 if
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 meant
1 to
1 attack
1 us
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 disputed
1 every
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 passage
1 through
1 the
1 woods
1 after
1 we
1 had
1 once
1 crossed
1 the
1 Prah
1 Had
1 they
1 done
1 so
1 it
1 may
1 be
1 confidently
1 affirmed
1 that
1 we
1 could
1 never
1 have
1 got
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 Their
1 policy
1 should
1 have
1 been
1 to
1 avoid
1 any
1 pitched
1 battle
1 but
1 to
1 throng
1 the
1 woods
1 on
1 either
1 side
1 continually
1 harassing
1 the
1 troops
1 on
1 their
1 march
1 preventing
1 the
1 men
1 working
1 on
1 the
1 roads
1 and
1 rendering
1 it
1 impossible
1 for
1 the
1 carriers
1 to
1 go
1 along
1 unless
1 protected
1 on
1 either
1 side
1 by
1 lines
1 of
1 troops
1 Even
1 when
1 unopposed
1 it
1 was
1 difficult
1 enough
1 to
1 keep
1 the
1 carriers
1 who
1 were
1 constantly
1 deserting
1 but
1 had
1 they
1 been
1 exposed
1 to
1 continuous
1 attacks
1 there
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 no
1 possibility
1 of
1 keeping
1 them
1 together
1 It
1 was
1 then
1 a
1 strong
1 argument
1 in
1 favor
1 of
1 peace
1 that
1 we
1 had
1 been
1 permitted
1 to
1 advance
1 thirty
1 miles
1 into
1 their
1 country
1 without
1 a
1 shot
1 being
1 fired
1 Upon
1 the
1 other
1 hand
1 no
1 messengers
1 had
1 been
1 sent
1 down
1 to
1 meet
1 us
1 no
1 ambassadors
1 had
1 brought
1 messages
1 from
1 the
1 king
1 This
1 silence
1 was
1 ominous
1 nor
1 were
1 other
1 signs
1 wanting
1 At
1 one
1 place
1 a
1 fetish
1 consisting
1 of
1 a
1 wooden
1 gun
1 and
1 several
1 wooden
1 daggers
1 all
1 pointing
1 towards

1 was
1 placed
1 in
1 the

1 of
1 the

1 Several
1 kids
1 had
1 been
1 found
1 buried
1 in
1 calabashes
1 in
1 the
1 path
1 pierced
1 through
1 and
1 through
1 with
1 stakes
1 while
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 outside
1 Queesa
1 the
1 dead
1 body
1 of
1 a
1 slave
1 killed
1 and
1 mutilated
1 but
1 a
1 few
1 hours
1 before
1 we
1 entered
1 it
1 was
1 hanging
1 from
1 a
1 tree
1 Other
1 fetishes
1 of
1 a
1 more
1 common
1 sort
1 were
1 to

1 at

1 lines
1 of

1 and

1 stretched
1 across

1 the
1 Naval
1 Brigade
1 with

1 and

1 marched
1 into

1 and
1 the
1 same
1 afternoon
1 the
1 whole
1 marched
1 forward
1 to
1 Fomana
1 the
1 capital
1 of
1 Adansee
1 situated
1 half
1 a
1 mile
1 only
1 from

1 This
1 was
1 a

1 town
1 capable
1 of
1 containing
1 some
1 seven
1 or
1 eight
1 thousand
1 inhabitants
1 The
1 architecture
1 was
1 similar
1 to
1 that
1 of

1 but
1 the

1 was
1 a
1 large
1 structure
1 covering
1 a
1 considerable
1 extent
1 of

1 Here
1 were
1 the
1 apartments
1 of

1 of

1 room
1 and
1 the
1 room
1 for

1 still
1 smelling
1 horribly
1 of
1 the
1 blood
1 with
1 which
1 the

1 were
1 sprinkled
1 The

1 effect

1 The

1 that

1 was
1 to
1 proceed

1 than
1 a

1 across
1 a
1 stream
1 behind

1 been
1 requested
1 by
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 to
1 accompany
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 as
1 his
1 knowledge
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 tactics
1 might
1 be
1 of
1 value
1 and
1 he
1 might
1 be
1 able
1 by
1 the
1 shouts
1 of
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 to
1 understand
1 the
1 orders
1 issued
1 to

1 The
1 head
1 of

1 4
1 2d

1 experienced
1 no

1 whatever
1 until
1 they
1 issued
1 from
1 the
1 bush
1 into
1 the
1 little
1 clearing
1 surrounding
1 the
1 village
1 which
1 consisted
1 only
1 of
1 four
1 or
1 five
1 houses
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 discharged
1 their
1 muskets
1 hastily
1 as
1 the
1 first
1 white
1 men
1 showed
1 themselves
1 but
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 leading
1 files
1 of
1 the
1 column
1 quickly
1 cleared
1 them
1 away
1 The
1 4
1 2d
1 pushed
1 on
1 through
1 the
1 village
1 and
1 then
1 forming
1 in

1 line
1 advanced
1 For
1 the
1 first
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 hundred
1 yards
1 they
1 encountered
1 no
1 serious
1 opposition
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 then
1 received
1 by
1 a
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 from
1 an
1 unseen
1 foe
1 in
1 front
1 The
1 left
1 column
1 had
1 not
1 gone
1 a
1 hundred
1 yards
1 before
1 they
1 too
1 came
1 under
1 fire
1 Captain
1 Buckle
1 of
1 the
1 Engineers
1 who
1 was
1 with
1 the
1 Engineer

1 occupied
1 in

1 the
1 path
1 ahead
1 of
1 the
1 advancing
1 column
1 was
1 shot
1 through
1 the
1 heart
1 A
1 similar
1 opposition
1 was
1 experienced
1 by
1 the
1 right
1 The
1 roar
1 of
1 the
1 fire
1 was
1 tremendous
1 so
1 heavy
1 indeed
1 that
1 all
1 sound
1 of
1 individual
1 reports
1 was
1 lost
1 and
1 the
1 noise
1 was
1 one
1 hoarse
1 hissing
1 roar
1 Even
1 the
1 crack
1 of
1 Rait
1 s
1 guns
1 was
1 lost
1 in
1 the
1 general
1 uproar
1 but
1 the
1 occasional
1 rush
1 of
1 a
1 rocket
1 of
1 which
1 two
1 troughs
1 with
1 parties
1 of
1 Rait
1 s
1 men
1 accompanied

1 wing
1 was
1 distinctly

1 The
1 4
1 2d
1 could
1 for
1 a
1 time
1 make
1 scarcely
1 any
1 way
1 and
1 the
1 flanking
1 columns
1 were
1 also
1 brought
1 to
1 a
1 stand
1 Owing
1 to
1 the
1 extreme
1 thickness
1 of
1 the
1 wood
1 and
1 their
1 ignorance
1 of
1 the
1 nature
1 of
1 the
1 ground
1 these
1 columns
1 were
1 unable
1 to
1 keep
1 in
1 their
1 proper
1 position
1 and
1 diverged
1 considerably
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 however
1 made
1 no
1 effort
1 to
1 penetrate
1 between
1 them
1 and
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 For
1 an
1 hour
1 this
1 state
1 of
1 things
1 continued
1 The
1 company
1 of
1 the
1 2
1 3d
1 advanced
1 along
1 the
1 main
1 road
1 to
1 help
1 to
1 clear
1 the
1 bush
1 where
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 still
1 fought
1 stubbornly
1 not
1 two
1 hundred
1 yards
1 from
1 the
1 village
1 while
1 two
1 companies
1 of
1 the
1 Rifle
1 Brigade
1 were
1 sent
1 up
1 the
1 left

1 to
1 keep
1 touch
1 with
1 the
1 rear
1 of
1 Russell
1 s
1 regiment
1 hen
1 the
1 fight
1 commenced
1 in
1 earnest
1 and
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 were
1 brought
1 to
1 a
1 stand
1 by
1 the
1 enemy
1 Frank
1 lay
1 down
1 with
1 the
1 soldiers
1 Not
1 a
1 foe
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 but
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 broke
1 out
1 incessantly
1 from
1 the
1 bushes
1 some
1 twenty
1 yards
1 ahead
1 The
1 air
1 above
1 was
1 literally
1 alive
1 with
1 slugs
1 and
1 a
1 perfect
1 shower
1 of
1 leaves
1 continued
1 to
1 fall
1 upon
1 the
1 path
1 So
1 bewilderingly
1 dense
1 was
1 the
1 bush
1 that
1 the
1 men
1 soon
1 lost
1 all
1 idea
1 of
1 the
1 points
1 of
1 the
1 compass
1 and
1 fired
1 in
1 any
1 direction
1 from
1 which
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 shots
1 came
1 Thus
1 it
1 happened
1 that
1 the
1 sailors
1 sent
1 in
1 complaints
1 to
1 the
1 general
1 that
1 the
1 2
1 3d
1 and
1 4
1 2d
1 were
1 firing
1 at
1 them
1 while
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 and
1 2
1 3d
1 made
1 the
1 same
1 complaint
1 against
1 the
1 Naval
1 Brigade
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 who
1 had
1 taken
1 up
1 his
1 headquarters
1 at
1 the
1 village
1 sent
1 out
1 repeated
1 instructions
1 to
1 the
1 commanding
1 officers
1 to
1 warn
1 their
1 men
1 to
1 avoid
1 this
1 error
1 For
1 two
1 hours
1 the
1 fight
1 went
1 on
1 Then
1 the
1 column
1 to
1 the
1 left
1 found
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 in
1 front
1 of
1 them
1 had
1 fallen
1 back
1 they
1 had
1 however
1 altogether
1 lost
1 touch
1 of
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 They
1 were
1 accordingly
1 ordered
1 to
1 cut
1 a
1 road
1 to
1 the
1 northeast
1 until
1 they
1 came
1 in
1 contact
1 with
1 them
1 In
1 doing
1 so
1 they
1 came
1 upon
1 a
1 partial
1 clearing
1 where
1 a
1 sharp
1 opposition
1 was
1 experienced
1 The
1 Houssas
1 carried
1 the
1 open
1 ground
1 at
1 a
1 rush
1 but
1 the
1 enemy
1 as
1 usual
1 opened
1 a
1 heavy
1 fire
1 from
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 bush
1 The
1 Houssas
1 were
1 recalled
1 and
1 fire
1 was
1 opened
1 with
1 the
1 rockets
1 which
1 soon
1 drove
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 back
1 and
1 the
1 cutting

1 was
1 proceeded
1 with
1 In

1 meantime
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 was
1 having
1 a
1 hard
1 time
1 of
1 it
1 They
1 had
1 fought
1 their
1 way
1 to
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 swamp
1 beyond
1 which
1 lay
1 an
1 immense
1 Ashanti
1 camp
1 and
1 here
1 the
1 fire
1 was
1 so
1 tremendously
1 heavy
1 that
1 the
1 advance
1 was
1 again
1 completely
1 arrested
1 Not
1 an
1 enemy
1 was
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 but
1 from
1 every
1 bush
1 of
1 the
1 opposite
1 side
1 puffs
1 of
1 smoke
1 came
1 thick
1 and
1 fast
1 and
1 a
1 perfect
1 rain
1 of
1 slugs
1 swept
1 over

1 poured
1 round
1 after

1 into
1 the
1 enemy
1 until
1 their
1 fire
1 slackened
1 a
1 little
1 and
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 leaping
1 to
1 their
1 feet
1 struggled
1 across
1 the
1 swamp
1 which
1 was
1 over

1 deep
1 Step
1 by
1 step
1 they
1 won
1 their
1 way
1 through
1 the
1 camp
1 and
1 up
1 the
1 hill
1 Everywhere
1 the
1 dead
1 Ashantis
1 lay
1 in
1 heaps
1 attesting
1 the
1 terrible
1 effect
1 of
1 the
1 Snider
1 fire
1 and
1 the
1 determination
1 with
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 fought
1 Beyond
1 the
1 camp
1 upon
1 the
1 hills
1 the

1 was

1 where

1 for

1 white
1 soldiers
1 to
1 skirmish
1 through
1 the
1 bush
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 made
1 a

1 desperate
1 stand
1 The
1 narrow
1 lane
1 up
1 which

1 to

1 up
1 a
1 fire
1 from
1 the
1 houses
1 but
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 soon
1 drove
1 them
1 out
1 and
1 a
1 single
1 shot
1 from
1 the
1 gun
1 down
1 the
1 wide
1 street
1 which
1 divided
1 the
1 town
1 into
1 two
1 portions
1 bursting
1 in
1 the
1 midst
1 of
1 a
1 group
1 at
1 the
1 further
1 end
1 killed
1 eight
1 and
1 drove
1 all
1 further
1 idea
1 of
1 resistance
1 in
1 that
1 direction
1 from
1 their
1 minds
1 It
1 was
1 now
1 about
1 twelve
1 o
1 clock
1 but
1 although
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 lost
1 their
1 camp
1 and
1 village
1 and
1 had
1 suffered
1 terribly
1 they
1 were
1 not
1 yet
1 finally
1 beaten
1 They
1 had
1 moved
1 the
1 principal
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 forces
1 which
1 had
1 been
1 engaged
1 upon
1 our
1 left
1 round
1 to
1 the
1 right
1 were
1 pressing
1 hard
1 upon
1 the
1 column
1 there
1 and
1 the
1 2
1 3d
1 and
1 were
1 cutting
1 in
1 between
1 the
1 latter
1 and
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 when
1 a
1 fortunate
1 accident
1 enabled
1 us
1 to
1 meet
1 this
1 attack
1 more
1 effectively
1 The
1 left
1 column
1 had
1 cut
1 its
1 path
1 rather
1 too
1 much
1 to
1 the
1 east
1 and
1 came
1 into
1 the
1 road
1 between
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 and
1 2
1 3d
1 forming
1 a
1 connecting
1 link
1 between
1 them
1 while
1 the
1 right
1 column
1 having
1 at
1 last
1 cut
1 away
1 the
1 whole
1 of
1 the
1 brush
1 wood
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 had
1 so
1 long
1 wedged
1 themselves
1 between
1 them
1 and
1 the
1 road
1 were
1 now
1 in
1 direct
1 communication
1 with
1 the
1 2
1 3d
1 They
1 had
1 been
1 reinforced
1 by
1 a
1 company
1 of
1 the
1 Rifle
1 Brigade
1 Our
1 front
1 therefore
1 was
1 now
1 entirely
1 changed
1 and
1 faced
1 east
1 instead
1 of
1 north
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 in
1 vain
1 tried
1 to
1 break
1 the
1 line
1 but
1 desisted
1 from
1 their
1 efforts
1 The
1 firing
1 died
1 away
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 thought
1 that
1 the
1 battle
1 was
1 over
1 when
1 at
1 about
1 a
1 quarter
1 to
1 one
1 a
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 broke
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 rear
1 of
1 the
1 column
1 showing
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 making
1 a
1 last
1 and
1 desperate
1 effort
1 to
1 turn
1 our
1 flank
1 and
1 to
1 retake
1 the
1 village
1 from
1 which
1 we
1 had
1 driven
1 them
1 at
1 eight
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 So
1 near
1 was
1 the
1 rear
1 of
1 the
1 column
1 to
1 the
1 village
1 that
1 the
1 slugs
1 fell
1 fast
1 into
1 the
1 reserve
1 who
1 were
1 stationed
1 there
1 Three
1 companies
1 of
1 the
1 Rifles
1 were
1 sent
1 up
1 to
1 strengthen
1 the
1 line
1 and
1 for
1 three
1 quarters
1 of
1 an
1 hour
1 the
1 roar
1 of
1 the
1 musketry
1 was
1 as
1 heavy
1 and
1 continuous
1 as
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 at
1 any
1 time
1 during
1 the
1 day
1 Then
1 as
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 fire
1 slackened
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 gave
1 the
1 word
1 for
1 the
1 line
1 to
1 advance
1 sweeping
1 round
1 from
1 the
1 rear
1 so
1 as
1 to
1 drive
1 the
1 enemy
1 northwards
1 before
1 them
1 The
1 movement
1 was
1 admirably
1 executed
1 The
1 Bonny
1 men
1 of
1 ood
1 s
1 regiment
1 who
1 had
1 fought
1 silently
1 and
1 steadily
1 all
1 the
1 time
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 been
1 on
1 the
1 defensive
1 now
1 raised
1 their
1 shrill
1 war
1 cry
1 and
1 slinging
1 their
1 rifles
1 and
1 drawing
1 their
1 swords
1 -
1 -their
1 favorite
1 weapons
1 -
1 -dashed
1 forward
1 like
1 so
1 many
1 panthers
1 let
1 loose
1 By
1 their
1 side
1 skirmishing
1 as
1 quietly
1 and
1 steadily
1 as
1 if
1 on
1 parade
1 the
1 men
1 of
1 the
1 Rifle
1 Brigade
1 searched
1 every
1 bush
1 with
1 their
1 bullets
1 and
1 in
1 five
1 minutes
1 from
1 the
1 commencement
1 of
1 the
1 advance
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 in
1 full
1 and
1 final
1 retreat
1 The
1 battle
1 ended
1 at
1 about
1 half
1 past
1 one
1 having
1 lasted
1 five
1 hours
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 The
1 Ashantis
1 were
1 supposed
1 to
1 have
1 had
1 from
1 fifteen
1 to
1 twenty
1 thousand
1 men
1 in
1 the
1 field
1 hat
1 their
1 loss
1 was
1 could
1 not
1 accurately
1 be
1 calculated
1 as
1 they
1 carry
1 off
1 their
1 dead
1 as
1 fast
1 as
1 they
1 fall
1 but
1 where
1 rushes
1 were
1 made
1 by
1 our
1 troops
1 as
1 they
1 had
1 not
1 time
1 to
1 do
1 this
1 they
1 lay
1 everywhere
1 thick
1 on
1 the
1 ground
1 By
1 the
1 most
1 moderate
1 computation
1 they
1 must
1 have
1 lost
1 over
1 two
1 thousand
1 Ammon
1 Quatia
1 himself
1 was
1 killed
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 Aboo
1 one
1 of

1 six
1 great
1 tributary
1 kings
1 The
1 body
1 of

1 s
1 chief
1 executioner
1 was
1 also
1 pointed
1 out
1 by
1 some
1 of
1 the
1 prisoners
1 They
1 fought
1 with
1 extraordinary
1 pluck
1 and
1 resolution
1 as
1 was
1 shown
1 by
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 although
1 wretchedly
1 armed
1 for
1 upwards
1 of
1 five
1 hours
1 they
1 resisted
1 the
1 attack
1 of
1 troops
1 armed
1 with
1 breech
1 loaders
1 and
1 supported
1 by
1 guns
1 and
1 rockets
1 Their
1 position
1 was
1 a
1 good
1 one
1 and
1 they
1 had
1 no
1 doubt
1 calculated
1 upon
1 coming
1 down
1 upon
1 us
1 from
1 the
1 rising
1 ground
1 either
1 on
1 the
1 flank
1 or
1 rear
1 with
1 advantage
1 should
1 we
1 succeed
1 in
1 pushing
1 forward
1 Upon
1 our
1 side
1 the
1 loss
1 in
1 killed
1 was
1 very
1 slight
1 not
1 exceeding
1 eight

1 by

1 Although
1 the
1 attacking

1 was
1 very
1 greatly
1 superior
1 and
1 took
1 the

1 by

1 -

1 while

1 and

1 success
1 not
1 only
1 beating
1 off
1 the
1 enemy
1 whenever
1 they
1 attacked
1 but
1 sallying
1 out
1 and
1 assisting
1 to
1 bring
1 in
1 a
1 convoy
1 of
1 stores
1 which
1 was
1 close
1 at
1 hand
1 when
1 the
1 attack
1 began
1 Amoaful
1 was
1 a
1 town
1 capable
1 of

1 two
1 or
1 three
1 thousand
1 inhabitants
1 Great
1 quantities
1 of
1 grain
1 and

1 flour
1 were
1 found
1 here
1 These
1 were
1 done
1 up
1 in
1 bundles
1 of

1 plantain
1 leaves
1 each
1 bundle
1 weighing
1 from
1 five
1 to

1 pounds
1 This
1 capture
1 was
1 of
1 great
1 service
1 to
1 the
1 commissariat
1 as
1 it
1 afforded
1 an
1 abundant
1 supply
1 of
1 excellent
1 food
1 for
1 the
1 carriers
1 The
1 troops
1 were
1 in

1 spirits
1 that
1 night
1 They
1 had
1 won
1 a
1 battle

1 and
1 that
1 with
1 a
1 minimum
1 of

1 There
1 were
1 therefore
1 no

1 of

1 Frank
1 had

1 twice
1 struck
1 with
1 slugs
1 but
1 in
1 neither

1 had
1 these
1 penetrated
1 deeply
1 and

1 to
1 sit
1 round
1 the
1 camp
1 fire
1 and
1 to
1 enjoy
1 his
1 glass
1 of
1 rum
1 and
1 water
1 Two
1 kegs
1 of

1 were
1 the
1 only
1 stores
1 which
1 that
1 night
1 came
1 up
1 from
1 the
1 rear
1 thanks
1 to
1 the
1 consideration
1 of
1 a
1 commissariat
1 officer
1 to
1 whom
1 the
1 soldiers
1 felt
1 extremely
1 grateful
1 for

1 with
1 an
1 invigorating
1 drink
1 after
1 their
1 long
1 and
1 fatiguing
1 labors
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 At
1 about
1 a
1 mile
1 and
1 a
1 quarter
1 from
1 Amoaful
1 lay
1 the

1 Bequah
1 the

1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 powerful
1 of

1 kings
1 Here
1 a
1 considerable
1 force
1 was
1 known
1 to
1 be
1 collected
1 before
1 the
1 battle
1 and
1 here
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 fugitives
1 were
1 believed
1 to

1 rallied
1 It
1 would
1 have
1 been

1 to

1 and
1 leave
1 this
1 hostile
1 camp
1 so
1 close
1 to
1 a
1 station
1 in

1 rear
1 Lord
1 Gifford
1 was
1 therefore
1 sent
1 out
1 at
1 daybreak
1 to
1 reconnoiter
1 it
1 He
1 approached
1 it
1 closely
1 when
1 twenty
1 men
1 sprang
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 bush
1 and
1 fired
1 at
1 him
1 fortunately
1 without
1 hitting
1 him
1 hen
1 he
1 returned
1 and
1 made
1 his
1 report
1 the
1 general
1 determined
1 to
1 attack
1 and
1 burn
1 the
1 place
1 and
1 orders
1 were
1 issued
1 for
1 a
1 column
1 consisting
1 of
1 Russell

1 at

1 The
1 march

1 through
1 the
1 bush
1 but
1 as
1 the
1 scouts
1 entered
1 the
1 clearing
1 a
1 heavy
1 fire
1 was
1 opened
1 upon
1 them
1 Lord
1 Gifford
1 and
1 almost
1 the
1 whole
1 of

1 party
1 were
1 more
1 or
1 less
1 severely
1 wounded
1 when
1 the
1 sailors
1 rushed
1 in
1 to
1 their
1 support
1 For
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 the
1 enemy
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 heavy
1 fire
1 from
1 the
1 houses
1 and
1 then
1 fled
1 leaving
1 about
1 forty
1 of

1 number
1 dead
1 on

1 ground
1 The
1 town
1 which
1 was
1 about

1 the

1 of

1 was
1 burned
1 and
1 the
1 column
1 returned
1 to
1 the
1 camp
1 A
1 great
1 portion
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 was
1 destroyed
1 and
1 the

1 and
1 then
1 all
1 was
1 in
1 readiness
1 for
1 the
1 advance
1 upon
1 Coomassie
1 Amoaful
1 was
1 to
1 be

1 in
1 charge
1 of
1 the
1 2d
1 est
1 Indians
1 who
1 had
1 now
1 come
1 up
1 Each
1 man
1 received
1 four
1 days

1 and
1 each
1 regiment
1 was
1 to
1 take
1 charge
1 of
1 its
1 own
1 provision
1 and
1 baggage
1 The
1 advance
1 started
1 at

1 the
1 morning
1 Russell
1 s
1 regiment
1 Rait
1 s
1 battery
1 and
1 the

1 Then
1 came
1 the

1 by

1 4
1 2d
1 and
1 Naval
1 Brigade
1 The
1 hammocks
1 and

1 went
1 on
1 with
1 the
1 troops
1 The
1 rest
1 of
1 the

1 remained
1 behind
1 The
1 road
1 differed
1 in
1 nothing
1 from
1 that
1 which
1 had
1 so
1 long
1 been
1 followed
1 It
1 bore
1 everywhere
1 marks
1 of
1 the
1 retreating
1 enemy
1 in

1 and

1 articles
1 scattered
1 about

1 its
1 plants
1 and

1 trampled
1 into
1 the
1 ground
1 six
1 feet
1 in

1 showing
1 that
1 the
1 usual
1 negro
1 way
1 of
1 walking
1 in
1 single
1 file
1 had
1 been
1 abandoned
1 The
1 rate
1 of
1 progression
1 was
1 slow
1 as
1 the
1 country
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 thoroughly
1 searched
1 by
1 the
1 advance
1 There
1 were

1 to
1 be
1 crossed
1 each
1 causing
1 a
1 delay
1 At

1 camp
1 where

1 thousand
1 men
1 were
1 assembled
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 stand
1 The
1 defense
1 was
1 however
1 feeble
1 in

1 and
1 it

1 the

1 firing
1 wildly
1 altogether
1 beyond

1 Several

1 precipitately
1 to

1 bush
1 A

1 to

1 on
1 from

1 The
1 troops
1 were
1 set
1 to

1 to
1 cut
1 the

1 round
1 the
1 village
1 which
1 was
1 a

1 small
1 one
1 and
1 a
1 breastwork
1 was
1 thrown
1 up

1 The

1 without

1 News
1 came
1 in
1 that
1 night
1 that
1 Captain
1 Butler
1 with
1 the
1 estern
1 Akims
1 had
1 arrived
1 within
1 two
1 days
1 march
1 of

1 but
1 that
1 without
1 the
1 slightest
1 reason
1 the
1 king
1 and
1 the
1 whole
1 of
1 his
1 army
1 had
1 left
1 Captain
1 Butler
1 and
1 retired
1 suddenly
1 to
1 the
1 Prah
1 At
1 the
1 same
1 time
1 they
1 heard
1 that
1 the
1 army
1 of
1 the
1 assaws
1 under
1 Captain
1 Dalrymple
1 had
1 also
1 broken
1 up
1 without
1 having
1 come
1 in
1 contact
1 with
1 the
1 enemy
1 From
1 the
1 rear
1 also
1 unpleasant
1 news
1 came
1 up
1 The
1 attack
1 upon
1 Quarman
1 had
1 been
1 no
1 isolated
1 event
1 Fomana
1 had
1 also
1 been
1 attacked
1 but
1 the
1 garrison
1 there
1 had
1 after
1 some
1 hours
1 fighting
1 repulsed
1 the
1 enemy
1 Several
1 convoys
1 had
1 been
1 assaulted
1 and
1 the
1 whole
1 road
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 Prah
1 was
1 unsafe
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 after

1 came
1 safely
1 in

1 Gifford

1 and

1 being
1 as
1 usual
1 in

1 The
1 resistance
1 increased
1 with
1 every
1 step
1 and
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 column
1 was
1 constantly
1 engaged
1 Several
1 villages
1 were
1 taken
1 by
1 Russell
1 s
1 regiment
1 who
1 full
1 of
1 confidence
1 in

1 It
1 was
1 but

1 and

1 Consequently

1 until

1 hours
1 on

1 that
1 the

1 THE
1 CAPTURE
1 OF
1 COOMASSIE
1 Upon
1 the
1 afternoon
1 of
1 the
1 arrival
1 of
1 the
1 English
1 column
1 upon
1 the
1 Dah
1 the
1 king
1 made
1 another
1 attempt
1 to
1 arrest
1 their
1 progress
1 with
1 a
1 view
1 no
1 doubt
1 of
1 bringing
1 up
1 fresh
1 reinforcements
1 A
1 flag
1 of
1 truce
1 came
1 in
1 with
1 a
1 letter
1 to
1 the
1 effect
1 that
1 our
1 rapid
1 advance
1 had
1 much
1 disconcerted
1 him
1 which
1 was
1 no
1 doubt
1 true
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 not
1 been
1 able
1 to
1 make
1 arrangements
1 for
1 the
1 payments
1 claimed
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 send
1 in
1 hostages
1 but
1 that
1 most
1 of
1 those
1 whom
1 the
1 general
1 had
1 asked
1 for
1 were
1 away
1 and
1 that
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 agree
1 to
1 give
1 the
1 queen
1 mother
1 or
1 the
1 heir
1 apparent
1 These
1 were
1 of
1 course
1 the
1 principal
1 hostages
1 indeed
1 the
1 only
1 ones
1 who
1 would
1 be
1 of
1 any
1 real
1 value
1 The
1 answer
1 was
1 accordingly
1 sent
1 back
1 that
1 unless
1 these
1 personages
1 arrived
1 before
1 daybreak
1 the
1 next
1 morning
1 we
1 should
1 force
1 our
1 way
1 into
1 Coomassie
1 The
1 Dah
1 is
1 a
1 river
1 about
1 fifteen
1 yards
1 wide
1 and
1 three
1 feet
1 deep
1 at
1 the
1 deepest
1 place
1 The
1 Engineers
1 set
1 to
1 work
1 to
1 bridge
1 it
1 directly
1 they
1 arrived
1 Russell
1 s
1 regiment
1 at
1 once
1 crossing
1 the
1 river
1 and
1 bivouacking
1 on
1 the
1 opposite
1 bank
1 It
1 was
1 unfortunate
1 that
1 this
1 the
1 first
1 night
1 upon
1 which
1 the
1 troops
1 had
1 been
1 unprovided
1 with
1 tents
1 should
1 have
1 turned
1 out
1 tremendously
1 wet
1 The
1 thunder
1 roared
1 the
1 lightning
1 flashed
1 and
1 the
1 rain
1 came
1 down
1 incessantly
1 Tired
1 as
1 the
1 troops
1 were
1 there
1 were
1 few
1 who
1 slept
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 general
1 feeling
1 of
1 satisfaction
1 when
1 the
1 morning
1 broke
1 and
1 the
1 last
1 day
1 of
1 the
1 march
1 began
1 The
1 rain
1 held
1 up
1 a
1 little
1 before
1 daybreak
1 and
1 the
1 sky
1 was
1 clear
1 when
1 at
1 six
1 o
1 clock
1 ood
1 s
1 Bonny
1 men
1 who
1 had
1 come
1 up
1 by
1 a
1 forced
1 march
1 the
1 evening
1 before
1 led
1 the
1 advance
1 Lieutenant
1 Saunders
1 with
1 one
1 of
1 Rait
1 s
1 guns
1 came
1 next
1 The
1 Rifles
1 followed
1 in
1 support
1 Before
1 the
1 Bonny
1 men
1 had
1 gone
1 half
1 a
1 mile
1 they
1 were
1 hotly
1 engaged
1 and
1 the
1 combat
1 was
1 for
1 two
1 hours
1 a
1 repetition
1 of
1 that
1 of
1 Amoaful
1 Saunders
1 advanced
1 again
1 and
1 again
1 to
1 the
1 front
1 with
1 his
1 gun
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 few
1 rounds
1 of
1 grape
1 cleared
1 the
1 sides
1 of
1 the
1 path
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 At
1 last
1 however
1 the
1 Bonny
1 men
1 would
1 advance
1 no
1 farther
1 and
1 Lieutenant
1 Byre
1 the
1 adjutant
1 of
1 ood
1 s
1 regiment
1 was
1 mortally
1 wounded
1 Lieutenant
1 Saunders
1 sent
1 back
1 to
1 say
1 it
1 was
1 impossible
1 for
1 him
1 to
1 get
1 on
1 farther
1 unless
1 supported
1 by
1 white
1 troops
1 The
1 Rifles
1 were
1 then
1 sent
1 forward
1 to
1 take
1 the
1 Bonny
1 men
1 s
1 place
1 and
1 slowly
1 very
1 slowly
1 the
1 advance
1 was
1 continued
1 until
1 the
1 clearing
1 round
1 a
1 village
1 could
1 be
1 seen
1 fifty
1 yards
1 away
1 Then
1 the
1 Rifles
1 gave
1 a
1 cheer
1 and
1 with
1 a
1 sudden
1 rush
1 swept
1 through
1 to
1 the
1 open
1 and
1 carried
1 the
1 village
1 without
1 a
1 check
1 In
1 the
1 meantime
1 the
1 whole
1 column
1 had
1 been
1 following
1 in
1 the
1 rear
1 as
1 the
1 Rifles
1 advanced
1 and
1 were
1 hotly
1 engaged
1 in
1 repelling
1 a
1 series
1 of
1 flank
1 attacks
1 on
1 the
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 These
1 attacks
1 were
1 gallantly
1 persevered
1 in
1 by
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 who
1 at
1 times
1 approached
1 in
1 such
1 masses
1 that
1 the
1 whole
1 bush
1 swayed
1 and
1 moved
1 as
1 they
1 pushed
1 forward
1 Their
1 loss
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 extremely
1 large
1 for
1 our
1 men
1 lined
1 the
1 road
1 and
1 kept
1 up
1 a
1 tremendous
1 Snider
1 fire
1 upon
1 them
1 at
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 Our
1 casualties
1 were
1 slight
1 The
1 road
1 like
1 almost
1 all
1 roads
1 in
1 the
1 country
1 was
1 sunk
1 two
1 feet
1 in
1 the
1 center
1 below
1 the
1 level
1 of
1 the
1 surrounding
1 ground
1 consequently
1 the
1 men
1 were
1 lying
1 in
1 shelter
1 as
1 behind
1 a
1 breastwork
1 while
1 they
1 kept
1 up
1 their
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 upon
1 the
1 foe
1 The
1 village
1 once
1 gained
1 the
1 leading
1 troops
1 were
1 thrown
1 out
1 in
1 a
1 circle
1 round
1 it
1 and
1 the
1 order
1 was
1 given
1 to
1 pass
1 the
1 baggage
1 from
1 the
1 rear
1 to
1 the
1 village
1 The
1 operation
1 was
1 carried
1 out
1 in
1 safety
1 the
1 path
1 being
1 protected
1 by
1 the
1 troops
1 lying
1 in
1 a
1 line
1 along
1 it
1 The
1 baggage
1 once
1 in
1 the
1 troops
1 closed
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 village
1 the
1 disappointed
1 foe
1 continuing
1 a
1 series
1 of
1 desperate
1 attacks
1 upon
1 their
1 rear
1 These
1 assaults
1 were
1 kept
1 up
1 even
1 after
1 all
1 had
1 reached
1 the
1 cleared
1 space
1 of
1 the
1 village
1 the
1 enemy
1 s
1 war
1 horn
1 sounding
1 and
1 the
1 men
1 making
1 the
1 woods
1 re
1 -echo
1 with
1 their
1 wild
1 war
1 cry
1 The
1 Naval
1 Brigade
1 at
1 one
1 time
1 inflicted
1 great
1 slaughter
1 upon
1 the
1 enemy
1 by
1 remaining
1 perfectly
1 quiet
1 until
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 thinking
1 they
1 had
1 retired
1 advanced
1 full
1 of
1 confidence
1 cheering
1 when
1 a
1 tremendous
1 fire
1 almost
1 swept
1 them
1 away
1 It
1 was
1 six
1 hours
1 from
1 the
1 time
1 at
1 which
1 the
1 advance
1 began
1 before
1 the
1 rear
1 guard
1 entered
1 the
1 village
1 and
1 as
1 but
1 a
1 mile
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 had
1 been
1 traversed
1 and
1 Coomassie
1 was
1 still
1 six
1 miles
1 away
1 it
1 was
1 evident
1 that
1 if
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 continued
1 to
1 fight
1 with
1 the
1 same
1 desperation
1 and
1 if
1 the
1 baggage
1 had
1 to
1 be
1 carried
1 on
1 step
1 by
1 step
1 from
1 village
1 to
1 village
1 the
1 force
1 would
1 not
1 get
1 halfway
1 on
1 to
1 Coomassie
1 by
1 nightfall
1 The
1 instant
1 the
1 baggage
1 was
1 all
1 in
1 preparations
1 were
1 made
1 for
1 a
1 fresh
1 advance
1 Rait
1 s
1 guns
1 as
1 usual
1 opened
1 to
1 clear
1 the
1 way
1 and
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 this
1 time
1 led
1 the
1 advance
1 The
1 enemy
1 s
1 fire
1 was
1 very
1 heavy
1 and
1 the
1 Highlanders
1 at
1 first
1 advanced
1 but
1 slowly
1 their
1 wounded
1 straggling
1 back
1 in
1 quick
1 succession
1 into
1 the
1 village
1 After
1 twenty
1 minutes
1 work
1 however
1 they
1 had
1 pushed
1 back
1 the
1 enemy
1 beyond
1 the
1 brow
1 of
1 the
1 hill
1 and
1 from
1 this
1 point
1 they
1 advanced
1 with
1 great
1 rapidity
1 dashing
1 forward
1 at
1 times
1 at
1 the
1 double
1 until
1 the
1 foe
1 scared
1 by
1 the
1 sudden
1 onslaught
1 gave
1 way
1 altogether
1 and
1 literally
1 fled
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 their
1 speed
1 ar
1 drums
1 and
1 horns
1 chiefs
1 stools
1 and
1 umbrellas
1 littered
1 the
1 next
1 village
1 and
1 told
1 how
1 sudden
1 and
1 complete
1 had
1 been
1 the
1 stampede
1 As
1 the
1 4
1 2d
1 advanced
1 troops
1 were
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 sent
1 forward
1 until
1 a
1 despatch
1 came
1 in
1 from
1 Sir
1 A
1 Alison
1 saying
1 that
1 all
1 the
1 villages
1 save
1 the
1 last
1 were
1 taken
1 that
1 opposition
1 had
1 ceased
1 and
1 that
1 the
1 enemy
1 were
1 in
1 complete
1 rout
1 Up
1 to
1 this
1 time
1 the
1 attack
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 upon
1 the
1 rear
1 of
1 the
1 village
1 had
1 continued
1 with
1 unabated
1 vigor
1 and
1 shot
1 and
1 slug
1 continually
1 fell
1 in
1 the
1 place
1 itself
1 The
1 news
1 from
1 the
1 front
1 was
1 soon
1 known
1 and
1 was
1 hailed
1 with
1 a
1 cheer
1 which
1 went
1 right
1 round
1 the
1 line
1 of
1 defense
1 and
1 whether
1 scared
1 by
1 its
1 note
1 of
1 triumph
1 or
1 because
1 they
1 too
1 had
1 received
1 the
1 news
1 the
1 efforts
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 ceased
1 at
1 once
1 and
1 scarcely
1 another
1 shot
1 was
1 fired
1 At
1 half
1 past
1 three
1 the
1 baggage
1 was
1 sent
1 forward
1 and
1 the
1 headquarter
1 staff
1 and
1 Rifle
1 Brigade
1 followed
1 it
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 further
1 check
1 The
1 4
1 2d
1 and
1 several
1 companies
1 of
1 the
1 Rifle
1 Brigade
1 entered
1 Coomassie
1 without
1 another
1 shot
1 being
1 fired
1 in
1 its
1 defense
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 olseley
1 soon
1 after
1 arrived
1 and
1 taking
1 off
1 his
1 hat
1 called
1 for
1 three
1 cheers
1 for
1 the
1 Queen
1 which
1 was
1 responded
1 to
1 with
1 a
1 heartiness
1 and
1 vigor
1 which
1 must
1 have
1 astonished
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 These
1 were
1 still
1 in
1 considerable
1 numbers
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 having
1 been
1 told
1 by
1 the
1 king
1 that
1 peace
1 was
1 or
1 would
1 be
1 made
1 They
1 seemed
1 in
1 no
1 way
1 alarmed
1 but
1 watched
1 as
1 amused
1 and
1 interested
1 spectators
1 the
1 proceedings
1 of
1 the
1 white
1 troops
1 The
1 first
1 thing
1 to
1 be
1 done
1 was
1 to
1 disarm
1 those
1 who
1 had
1 guns
1 and
1 this
1 seemed
1 to
1 scare
1 the
1 others
1 for
1 in
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 the
1 town
1 was
1 almost
1 entirely
1 deserted
1 It
1 was
1 now
1 fast
1 getting
1 dark
1 and
1 the
1 troops
1 bivouacked
1 in
1 the
1 marketplace
1 which
1 had
1 so
1 often
1 been
1 the
1 scene
1 of
1 human
1 sacrifices
1 on
1 a
1 large
1 scale
1 Their
1 day
1 s
1 work
1 had
1 indeed
1 been
1 a
1 heavy
1 one
1 They
1 had
1 been
1 twelve
1 hours
1 on
1 the
1 road
1 without
1 rest
1 or
1 time
1 to
1 cook
1 food
1 ater
1 was
1 very
1 scarce
1 no
1 really
1 drinkable
1 water
1 having
1 been
1 met
1 with
1 during
1 the
1 day
1 In
1 addition
1 to
1 this
1 they
1 had
1 undergone
1 the
1 excitement
1 of
1 a
1 long
1 and
1 obstinate
1 fight
1 with
1 an
1 enemy
1 concealed
1 in
1 the
1 bush
1 after
1 work
1 of
1 almost
1 equal
1 severity
1 upon
1 the
1 day
1 before
1 and
1 had
1 passed
1 a
1 sleepless
1 night
1 in
1 a
1 tropical
1 rainstorm
1 yet
1 with
1 the
1 exception
1 of
1 a
1 few
1 fever
1 stricken
1 men
1 not
1 a
1 single
1 soldier
1 fell
1 out
1 from
1 his
1 place
1 in
1 the
1 ranks
1 Nor
1 was
1 the
1 first
1 night
1 in
1 Coomassie
1 destined
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 quiet
1 one
1 Soon
1 after
1 two
1 o
1 clock
1 a
1 fire
1 broke
1 out
1 in
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 largest
1 of
1 the
1 collections
1 of
1 huts
1 which
1 was
1 soon
1 in
1 a
1 blaze
1 from
1 end
1 to
1 end
1 The
1 engineers
1 pulled
1 down
1 the
1 huts
1 on
1 either
1 side
1 and
1 with
1 great
1 difficulty
1 prevented
1 the
1 flames
1 from
1 spreading
1 These
1 fires
1 were
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 carriers
1 and
1 others
1 plundering
1 and
1 one
1 man
1 a
1 policeman
1 caught
1 with
1 loot
1 upon
1 him
1 was
1 forthwith
1 hung
1 from
1 a
1 tree
1 Several
1 others
1 were
1 flogged
1 and
1 after
1 some
1 hours
1 excitement
1 the
1 place
1 quieted
1 down
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 was
1 greatly
1 vexed
1 at
1 the
1 occurrence
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 the
1 evening
1 before
1 sent
1 a
1 messenger
1 to
1 the
1 king
1 asking
1 him
1 to
1 come
1 in
1 and
1 make
1 peace
1 and
1 promising
1 to
1 spare
1 the
1 town
1 if
1 he
1 did
1 so
1 Although
1 Coomassie
1 was
1 well
1 known
1 to
1 Frank
1 he
1 was
1 still
1 ignorant
1 of
1 the
1 character
1 of
1 the
1 interior
1 of
1 the
1 chiefs
1 houses
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 day
1 he
1 wandered
1 about
1 with
1 almost
1 as
1 much
1 curiosity
1 as
1 the
1 soldiers
1 themselves
1 The
1 interiors
1 even
1 of
1 the
1 palaces
1 of
1 the
1 chiefs
1 showed
1 that
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 can
1 have
1 no
1 idea
1 of
1 what
1 we
1 call
1 comfort
1 The
1 houses
1 were
1 filled
1 with
1 dust
1 and
1 litter
1 and
1 this
1 could
1 not
1 be
1 accounted
1 for
1 solely
1 by
1 the
1 bustle
1 and
1 hurry
1 of
1 picking
1 out
1 the
1 things
1 worth
1 carrying
1 away
1 prior
1 to
1 the
1 hurried
1 evacuation
1 of
1 the
1 place
1 From
1 the
1 roofs
1 hung
1 masses
1 of
1 spiders
1 web
1 thick
1 with
1 dust
1 while
1 sweeping
1 a
1 place
1 out
1 before
1 occupying
1 it
1 brought
1 down
1 an
1 accumulation
1 of
1 dust
1 which
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 years
1 of
1 neglect
1 The
1 principal
1 apartments
1 were
1 lumbered
1 up
1 with
1 drums
1 great
1 umbrellas
1 and
1 other
1 paraphernalia
1 of
1 processions
1 such
1 as
1 horns
1 state
1 chairs
1 wooden
1 maces
1 etc
1 Before
1 the
1 door
1 of
1 each
1 house
1 stood
1 a
1 tree
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 which
1 were
1 placed
1 little
1 idols
1 calabashes
1 bits
1 of
1 china
1 bones
1 and
1 an
1 extraordinary
1 jumble
1 of
1 strange
1 odds
1 and
1 ends
1 of
1 every
1 kind
1 all
1 of
1 which
1 were
1 looked
1 upon
1 as
1 fetish
1 Over
1 the
1 doors
1 and

1 were
1 suspended
1 a
1 variety

1 old
1 stone
1 axes
1 and

1 tips
1 nuts
1 gourds
1 amulets
1 beads
1 and
1 other
1 trumpery
1 articles
1 The
1 palace
1 was
1 in
1 all
1 respects
1 exactly
1 as
1 the
1 king
1 had
1 left
1 it
1 The
1 royal
1 bed
1 and
1 couch
1 were
1 in
1 their
1 places
1 the
1 royal
1 chairs
1 occupied
1 their

1 raised
1 position
1 Only
1 curiously
1 enough
1 all
1 had
1 been
1 turned
1 round
1 and
1 over
1 The
1 storerooms
1 upstairs
1 were
1 untouched
1 and
1 here
1 was
1 found
1 an
1 infinite
1 variety
1 of

1 for

1 an

1 of
1 a
1 sale
1 room
1 In
1 many
1 of
1 the
1 native
1 apartments
1 of
1 the
1 palace
1 were
1 signs
1 that
1 human
1 sacrifice
1 had
1 been
1 carried
1 on
1 to
1 the
1 last
1 minute
1 Several
1 stools
1 were
1 found
1 covered
1 with
1 thick
1 coatings
1 of
1 recently
1 shed
1 blood
1 and
1 a
1 horrible
1 smell
1 of
1 gore
1 pervaded
1 the
1 whole
1 palace
1 and
1 indeed
1 the
1 whole
1 town
1 The
1 palace
1 was
1 full
1 of
1 fetish
1 objects
1 just
1 as
1 trumpery
1 and
1 meaningless
1 as
1 those
1 in
1 the
1 humblest
1 cottages
1 The
1 king
1 s
1 private
1 sitting
1 room
1 was
1 like
1 the
1 rest
1 an
1 open
1 court
1 with
1 a
1 tree
1 growing
1 in
1 it
1 This
1 tree
1 was
1 covered
1 with
1 fetish
1 objects
1 and
1 thickly
1 hung
1 with
1 spiders
1 webs
1 At
1 each
1 end
1 was
1 a
1 small
1 but
1 deep
1 alcove
1 with
1 a
1 royal
1 chair
1 so
1 that

1 sit
1 on
1 the
1 shady

1 Along
1 each
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 court
1 ran
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 verandah
1 beneath
1 which
1 was
1 an
1 immense
1 assortment
1 of

1 idols
1 and

1 of
1 all
1 kinds
1 From
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 verandahs
1 a
1 door
1 opened
1 into
1 the
1 king
1 s
1 bedroom
1 which
1 was
1 about
1 ten
1 feet
1 by
1 eight
1 It
1 was
1 very
1 dark
1 being
1 lighted
1 only
1 by

1 window
1 about

1 square
1 opening

1 upon
1 a
1 ledge
1 by
1 the
1 near
1 side
1 that
1 is
1 to
1 say
1 the
1 king
1 had
1 to
1 step
1 over
1 the
1 ledge
1 to
1 get
1 into
1 bed
1 were
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 pistols
1 and
1 other
1 weapons
1 among
1 them
1 an
1 English
1 general
1 s
1 sword
1 bearing
1 the
1 inscription
1 From
1 Queen
1 Victoria
1 to
1 the
1 King
1 of
1 Ashanti
1 This
1 sword
1 was
1 presented
1 to

1 of

1 Coffee
1 Upon
1 the
1 floor
1 at
1 the
1 end
1 opposite
1 the
1 bed
1 was
1 a
1 couch
1 upon
1 which

1 all

1 some
1 of

1 some
1 of

1 manufacture
1 were
1 found
1 scattered
1 about
1 in
1 the
1 wildest
1 confusion
1 The
1 terror
1 and
1 horror
1 of
1 the
1 four
1 or
1 five
1 hundred
1 ladies
1 when
1 they
1 found
1 that
1 their
1 husband
1 was
1 about
1 to
1 abandon
1 his
1 palace
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 no
1 time
1 to
1 remove
1 their
1 treasured
1 finery
1 can
1 be
1 well
1 imagined
1 In
1 almost
1 every
1 apartment
1 and
1 yard
1 of
1 the
1 palace
1 were
1 very
1 slightly
1 raised
1 mounds
1 some
1 no
1 larger
1 than
1 a
1 plate
1 others
1 two
1 or
1 even
1 three
1 feet
1 long
1 These
1 were
1 whitewashed
1 and
1 presented
1 a
1 strong
1 contrast
1 to
1 the
1 general
1 red
1 of
1 the
1 ground
1 and
1 lower
1 walls
1 These
1 patches
1 marked
1 the
1 places
1 of
1 graves
1 The
1 whole
1 palace
1 in
1 fact
1 appeared
1 to
1 be
1 little
1 better
1 than
1 a
1 cemetery
1 and
1 a
1 slaughterhouse
1 in
1 one
1 A
1 guard
1 was
1 placed
1 over
1 the
1 palace
1 and
1 here
1 as
1 elsewhere
1 through
1 the
1 town
1 looting
1 was
1 strictly
1 forbidden
1 All
1 day
1 the
1 general
1 expected
1 the
1 arrival
1 of
1 the
1 king
1 who
1 had
1 sent
1 a
1 messenger
1 to
1 say
1 he
1 would
1 be
1 in
1 early
1 At
1 two
1 o
1 clock
1 a
1 tremendous
1 rainstorm
1 broke
1 over
1 the
1 town
1 lasting
1 for
1 three
1 hours
1 In
1 the
1 evening
1 it
1 became
1 evident
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 again
1 deceiving
1 us
1 and
1 orders
1 were
1 issued
1 that
1 the
1 troops
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 should
1 push
1 on
1 another
1 three
1 miles
1 to
1 the
1 tombs
1 of
1 the
1 kings
1 where
1 he
1 was
1 said
1 to
1 be
1 staying
1 Later
1 on
1 however
1 the
1 news
1 came
1 that
1 the
1 king
1 had
1 gone
1 right
1 away
1 into
1 the
1 interior
1 and
1 as
1 another
1 storm
1 was
1 coming
1 up
1 it
1 became
1 evident
1 that
1 the
1 rainy
1 season
1 was
1 setting
1 in
1 in
1 earnest
1 The
1 determination
1 was
1 therefore
1 come
1 to
1 to
1 burn
1 the
1 town
1 and
1 to
1 start
1 for
1 the
1 coast
1 next
1 morning
1 All
1 night
1 Major
1 Home
1 with
1 a
1 party
1 of
1 Engineers
1 was
1 at
1 work
1 mining
1 the
1 palace
1 and
1 preparing
1 it
1 for
1 explosion
1 while
1 a
1 prize
1 committee
1 were
1 engaged
1 in
1 selecting
1 and
1 packing
1 everything
1 which
1 they
1 considered
1 worth
1 taking
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 The
1 news
1 of
1 the
1 change
1 of
1 plan
1 however
1 had
1 not
1 got
1 abroad
1 and
1 the
1 troops
1 paraded
1 next
1 morning
1 under
1 the
1 belief
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 about
1 to
1 march
1 still
1 farther
1 up
1 the
1 country
1 hen
1 it
1 became
1 known
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 bound
1 for
1 the
1 coast
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 general
1 brightening
1 of
1 faces
1 and
1 a
1 buzz
1 of
1 satisfaction
1 ran
1 down
1 the
1 ranks
1 It
1 was
1 true
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 believed
1 that
1 a
1 large
1 amount
1 of
1 treasure
1 was
1 collected
1 at
1 the
1 kings
1 tombs
1 and
1 the
1 prize
1 money
1 would
1 not
1 have
1 been
1 unwelcome
1 still
1 the
1 men
1 felt
1 that
1 their
1 powers
1 were
1 rapidly
1 becoming
1 exhausted
1 The
1 hope
1 of
1 a
1 fight
1 with
1 the
1 foe
1 and
1 of
1 the
1 capture
1 of
1 Coomassie
1 had
1 kept
1 them
1 up
1 upon
1 the
1 march
1 but
1 now
1 that
1 this
1 had
1 been
1 done
1 the
1 usual
1 collapse
1 after
1 great
1 exertion
1 followed
1 Every
1 hour
1 added
1 to
1 the
1 number
1 of
1 fever
1 stricken
1 men
1 who
1 would
1 have
1 to
1 be
1 carried
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 each
1 man
1 as
1 he
1 saw
1 his
1 comrades
1 fall
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 ranks
1 felt
1 that
1 his
1 own
1 turn
1 might
1 come
1 next
1 At
1 six
1 o
1 clock
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 the
1 advanced
1 guard
1 of
1 the
1 baggage
1 began
1 to
1 move
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 The
1 main
1 body
1 was
1 off
1 by
1 seven
1 The
1 4
1 2d
1 remained
1 as
1 rearguard
1 to
1 cover
1 the
1 Engineers
1 and
1 burning
1 party
1 Frank
1 stayed
1 behind
1 to
1 see
1 the
1 destruction
1 of
1 the
1 town
1 A
1 hundred
1 engineer
1 laborers
1 were
1 supplied
1 with
1 palm
1 leaf
1 torches
1 and
1 in
1 spite
1 of
1 the
1 outer
1 coats
1 of
1 thatch
1 being
1 saturated
1 by
1 the
1 tremendous
1 rains
1 the
1 flames
1 soon
1 spread
1 Volumes
1 of
1 black
1 smoke
1 poured
1 up
1 and
1 soon
1 a
1 huge
1 pile
1 of
1 smoke
1 resting
1 over
1 the
1 town
1 told
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 of
1 the
1 destruction
1 of
1 their
1 blood
1 stained
1 capital
1 The
1 palace
1 was
1 blown
1 up
1 and
1 when
1 the
1 Engineers
1 and
1 4
1 2d
1 marched
1 out
1 from
1 the
1 town
1 scarce
1 a
1 house
1 remained
1 untouched
1 by
1 the
1 flames
1 The
1 troops
1 had
1 proceeded
1 but
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 before
1 they
1 had
1 reason
1 to
1 congratulate
1 themselves
1 on
1 their
1 retreat
1 before
1 the
1 rains
1 began
1 in
1 earnest
1 and
1 to
1 rejoice
1 over
1 the
1 fact
1 that
1 the
1 thunderstorms
1 did
1 not
1 set
1 in
1 three
1 days
1 earlier
1 than
1 they
1 did
1 The
1 marsh
1 round
1 the
1 town
1 had
1 increased
1 a
1 foot
1 in
1 depth
1 while
1 the
1 next
1 stream
1 before
1 a
1 rivulet
1 two
1 feet
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 deep
1 had
1 now
1 swollen
1 its
1 banks
1 for
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 fifty
1 yards
1 on
1 either
1 side
1 with
1 over
1 five
1 feet
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 of
1 water
1 in
1 the
1 old
1 channel
1 Across
1 this
1 channel
1 the
1 Engineers
1 had
1 with
1 much
1 difficulty
1 thrown
1 a
1 tree
1 over
1 which
1 the
1 white
1 troops
1 passed
1 while
1 the
1 native
1 carriers
1 had
1 to
1 wade
1 across
1 It
1 was
1 laughable
1 to
1 see
1 only
1 the
1 eyes
1 of
1 the
1 taller
1 men
1 above
1 the
1 water
1 while
1 the
1 shorter
1 disappeared
1 altogether
1 nothing
1 being
1 seen
1 but
1 the
1 boxes
1 they
1 carried
1 Fortunately
1 the
1 deep
1 part
1 was
1 only
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 yards
1 wide
1 Thus
1 the
1 carriers
1 by
1 taking
1 a
1 long
1 breath
1 on
1 arriving
1 at
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 original
1 channel
1 were
1 able
1 to
1 struggle
1 across
1 This
1 caused
1 a
1 terrible
1 delay
1 and
1 a
1 still
1 greater
1 one
1 occurred
1 at
1 the
1 Dah
1 Here
1 the
1 water
1 was
1 more
1 than
1 two
1 feet
1 above
1 the
1 bridge
1 which
1 the
1 Engineers
1 had
1 made
1 on
1 the
1 passage
1 up
1 The
1 river
1 was
1 as
1 deep
1 as
1 the
1 previous
1 one
1 had
1 been
1 and
1 the
1 carriers
1 therefore
1 waded
1 as
1 before
1 but
1 the
1 deep
1 part
1 was
1 wider
1 so
1 wide
1 indeed
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 impossible
1 for
1 the
1 shorter
1 men
1 to
1 keep
1 under
1 water
1 long
1 enough
1 to
1 carry
1 their
1 burdens
1 across
1 The
1 tall
1 men
1 therefore
1 crossed
1 and
1 recrossed
1 with
1 the
1 burdens
1 the
1 short
1 men
1 swimming
1 over
1 The
1 passage
1 across
1 the
1 bridge
1 too
1 was
1 slow
1 and
1 tedious
1 in
1 the
1 extreme
1 Some
1 of
1 the
1 cross
1 planks
1 had
1 been
1 swept
1 away
1 and
1 each
1 man
1 had
1 to
1 feel
1 every
1 step
1 of
1 his
1 way
1 over
1 So
1 tedious
1 was
1 the
1 work
1 that
1 at
1 five
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 it
1 became
1 evident
1 that
1 it
1 would
1 be
1 impossible
1 for
1 all
1 the
1 white
1 troops
1 to
1 get
1 across
1 -
1 -a
1 process
1 at
1 once
1 slow
1 and
1 dangerous
1 -
1 -before
1 nightfall
1 The
1 river
1 was
1 still
1 rising
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 a
1 matter
1 of
1 importance
1 that
1 none
1 should
1 be
1 left
1 upon
1 the
1 other
1 side
1 at
1 night
1 as
1 the
1 Ashantis
1 might
1 for
1 anything
1 they
1 could
1 tell
1 be
1 gathering
1 in
1 force
1 in
1 the
1 rear
1 Consequently
1 Sir
1 Archibald
1 Alison
1 gave
1 the
1 order
1 for
1 the
1 white
1 troops
1 to
1 strip
1 and
1 to
1 wade
1 across
1 taking
1 only
1 their
1 helmets
1 and
1 guns
1 The
1 clothes
1 were
1 made
1 up
1 in
1 bundles
1 and
1 carried
1 over
1 by
1 natives
1 swimming
1 while
1 others
1 took
1 their
1 places
1 below
1 in
1 case
1 any
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 should
1 be
1 carried
1 off
1 their
1 feet
1 by
1 the
1 stream
1 All
1 passed
1 over
1 without
1 any
1 accident
1 One
1 result
1 however
1 was
1 a
1 laughable
1 incident
1 next
1 morning
1 an
1 incident
1 which
1 it
1 may
1 be
1 safely
1 asserted
1 never
1 before
1 occurred
1 in
1 the
1 British
1 army
1 It
1 was
1 quite
1 dark
1 before
1 the
1 last
1 party
1 were
1 over
1 and
1 the
1 natives
1 collecting
1 the
1 clothes
1 did
1 not
1 notice
1 those
1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 who
1 had
1 undressed
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 a
1 tree
1 Consequently
1 he
1 had
1 to
1 pass
1 the
1 night
1 a
1 very
1 wet
1 one
1 in
1 a
1 blanket
1 and
1 absolutely
1 paraded
1 with
1 his
1 regiment
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 in
1 nothing
1 but
1 a
1 helmet
1 and
1 rifle
1 The
1 incident
1 caused
1 immense
1 laughter
1 and
1 a
1 native
1 swimming
1 across
1 the
1 river
1 found
1 and
1 brought
1 back
1 his
1 clothes
1 As
1 the
1 journeys
1 were
1 necessarily
1 slow
1 and
1 tedious
1 owing
1 to
1 the
1 quantity
1 of
1 baggage
1 and
1 sick
1 being
1 carried
1 down
1 Frank
1 now
1 determined
1 to
1 push
1 straight
1 down
1 to
1 the
1 coast
1 and
1 bidding
1 goodbye
1 to
1 Sir
1 Garnet
1 and
1 the
1 many
1 friends
1 he
1 had
1 made
1 during
1 the
1 expedition
1 he
1 took
1 his
1 place
1 for
1 the
1 first
1 time
1 in
1 the
1 hammock
1 which
1 with
1 its
1 bearers
1 had
1 accompanied
1 him
1 from
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 and
1 started
1 for
1 the
1 sea
1 There
1 was
1 some
1 risk
1 as
1 far
1 as
1 the
1 Prah
1 for
1 straggling
1 bodies
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 frequently
1 intercepted
1 the
1 convoys
1 Frank
1 however
1 met
1 with
1 no
1 obstacle
1 and
1 in
1 ten
1 days
1 after
1 leaving
1 the
1 army
1 reached
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 Ostik
1 implored
1 his
1 master
1 to
1 take
1 him
1 with
1 him
1 across
1 the
1 sea
1 but
1 Frank
1 pointed
1 out
1 to
1 him
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 not
1 be
1 happy
1 long
1 in
1 England
1 where
1 the
1 customs
1 were
1 so
1 different
1 from
1 his
1 own
1 and
1 where
1 in
1 winter
1 he
1 would
1 feel
1 the
1 cold
1 terribly
1 Ostik
1 yielded
1 to
1 the
1 arguments
1 and
1 having
1 earned
1 enough
1 to
1 purchase
1 for
1 years
1 the
1 small
1 comforts
1 and
1 luxuries
1 dear
1 to
1 the
1 negro
1 heart
1 he
1 agreed
1 to
1 start
1 for
1 the
1 Gaboon
1 immediately
1 Frank
1 left
1 for
1 England
1 On
1 his
1 first
1 arrival
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 he
1 had
1 to
1 his
1 great
1 satisfaction
1 found
1 that
1 the
1 Houssas
1 who
1 had
1 escaped
1 from
1 Coomassie
1 had
1 succeeded
1 in
1 reaching
1 the
1 coast
1 in
1 safety
1 and
1 that
1 having
1 obtained
1 their
1 pay
1 from
1 the
1 agent
1 they
1 had
1 sailed
1 for
1 their
1 homes
1 Three
1 days
1 after
1 Frank
1 s
1 arrival
1 at
1 Cape
1 Coast
1 the
1 mail
1 steamer
1 came
1 along
1 and
1 he
1 took
1 passage
1 for
1 England
1 Very
1 strange
1 indeed
1 did
1 it
1 feel
1 to
1 him
1 when
1 he
1 set
1 foot
1 in
1 Liverpool
1 Nearly
1 two
1 years
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 had
1 elapsed
1 since
1 he
1 had
1 sailed
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 gone
1 through
1 adventures
1 sufficient
1 for
1 a
1 lifetime
1 He
1 was
1 but
1 eighteen
1 years
1 old
1 now
1 but
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 so
1 long
1 accustomed
1 to
1 do
1 man
1 s
1 work
1 that
1 he
1 felt
1 far
1 older
1 than
1 he
1 was
1 The
1 next
1 day
1 on
1 arriving
1 in
1 town
1 he
1 put
1 up
1 at
1 the
1 Charing
1 Cross
1 Hotel
1 and
1 then
1 sallied
1 out
1 to
1 see
1 his
1 friends
1 He
1 determined
1 to
1 go
1 first
1 of
1 all
1 to
1 visit
1 the
1 porter
1 who
1 had
1 been
1 the
1 earliest
1 friend
1 he
1 had
1 made
1 in
1 London
1 and
1 then
1 to
1 drive
1 to
1 Ruthven
1 s
1 where
1 he
1 was
1 sure
1 of
1 a
1 hearty
1 welcome
1 He
1 had
1 written
1 several
1 times
1 since
1 it
1 had
1 been
1 possible
1 for
1 him
1 to
1 send
1 letters
1 to
1 his
1 various
1 friends
1 first
1 of
1 all
1 to
1 his
1 sister
1 and
1 the
1 doctor
1 to
1 Ruthven
1 to
1 the
1 porter
1 and
1 to
1 the
1 old
1 naturalist
1 He
1 drove
1 to
1 London
1 Bridge
1 Station
1 and
1 there
1 learned
1 that
1 the
1 porter
1 had
1 been
1 for
1 a
1 week
1 absent
1 from
1 duty
1 having
1 strained
1 his
1 back
1 in
1 lifting
1 a
1 heavy
1 trunk
1 He
1 therefore
1 drove
1 to
1 Ratcliff
1 Highway
1 The
1 shop
1 was
1 closed
1 but
1 his
1 knock
1 brought
1 the
1 naturalist
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 hat
1 can
1 I
1 do
1 for
1 you
1 sir
1 he
1 asked
1 civilly
1 ell
1 in
1 the
1 first
1 place
1 you
1 can
1 shake
1 me
1 by
1 the
1 hand
1 The
1 old
1 man
1 started
1 at
1 the
1 voice
1 hy
1 tis
1 Frank
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 grown
1 and
1 sunburnt
1 out
1 of
1 all
1 recollection
1 My
1 dear
1 boy
1 I
1 am
1 glad
1 indeed
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 Come
1 in
1 come
1 in
1 John
1 is
1 inside
1 Frank
1 received
1 another
1 hearty
1 greeting
1 and
1 sat
1 for
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 hours
1 chatting
1 over
1 his
1 adventures
1 He
1 found
1 that
1 had
1 he
1 arrived
1 a
1 fortnight
1 later
1 he
1 would
1 not
1 have
1 found
1 either
1 of
1 his
1 friends
1 The
1 porter
1 was
1 in
1 a
1 week
1 about
1 to
1 be
1 married
1 again
1 to
1 a
1 widow
1 who
1 kept
1 a
1 small
1 shop
1 and
1 was
1 in
1 comfortable
1 circumstances
1 The
1 naturalist
1 had
1 sold
1 the
1 business
1 and
1 was
1 going
1 down
1 into
1 the
1 country
1 to
1 live
1 with
1 a
1 sister
1 there
1 After
1 leaving
1 them
1 Frank
1 drove
1 to
1 the
1 residence
1 of
1 Sir
1 James
1 Ruthven
1 in
1 Eaton
1 Square
1 Frank
1 sent
1 in
1 his
1 name
1 and
1 was
1 shown
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 drawing
1 room
1 A
1 minute
1 later
1 the
1 door
1 opened
1 with
1 a
1 crash
1 and
1 his
1 old
1 schoolfellow
1 rushed
1 in
1 My
1 dear
1 dear
1 old
1 boy
1 he
1 said
1 wringing
1 Frank
1 s
1 hand
1 I
1 am
1 glad
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 but
1 bless
1 me
1 how
1 you
1 have
1 changed
1 How
1 thin
1 you
1 are
1 and
1 how
1 black
1 I
1 should
1 have
1 passed
1 you
1 in
1 the
1 street
1 without
1 knowing
1 you
1 and
1 you
1 look
1 years
1 older
1 than
1 I
1 do
1 But
1 that
1 is
1 no
1 wonder
1 after
1 all
1 you
1 ve
1 gone
1 through
1 ell
1 when

1 you
1 arrive
1 and
1 where
1 are
1 your
1 things
1 hy
1 have
1 you
1 not
1 brought
1 them
1 here
1 Frank
1 said
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 left
1 them
1 at
1 the
1 hotel
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 going
1 down

1 He
1 stayed
1 however
1 and
1 dined
1 with
1 his
1 friend
1 whose
1 father
1 received
1 him
1 with
1 the
1 greatest
1 cordiality
1 and
1 kindness
1 On
1 leaving
1 the
1 hotel
1 next
1 morning
1 he
1 directed
1 his
1 portmanteau
1 to
1 be
1 sent
1 in
1 the
1 course
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 to
1 Sir

1 obtained
1 a
1 couple
1 of
1 suits
1 of
1 clothes
1 for
1 immediate
1 use
1 at
1 Liverpool
1 On
1 arriving
1 at
1 Deal
1 he
1 found
1 his
1 sister
1 much
1 grown
1 and
1 very
1 well
1 and
1 happy
1 She
1 was
1 almost
1 out
1 of
1 her
1 mind
1 with
1 delight
1 at
1 seeing
1 him
1 He
1 stayed
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 days
1 with
1 her
1 and
1 then
1 returned
1 to

1 You

1 Quite
1 enough
1 sir
1 Frank
1 said
1 I
1 have
1 made
1 up
1 my
1 mind
1 that
1 I
1 shall
1 be
1 a
1 doctor

1 necklace
1 which
1 I
1 showed

1 pounds
1 and
1 as

1 fact
1 that
1 Mr

1 told
1 me

1 intercourse
1 with

1 it
1 is
1 the
1 most
1 important
1 in
1 the
1 set
1 since
1 the
1 great
1 mass
1 of
1 pupils
1 in
1 our
1 common
1 schools
1 are
1 drawn
1 away
1 from
1 scholastic
1 pursuits
1 long
1 before
1 the
1 proper
1 time
1 for
1 entering
1 upon
1 any
1 course
1 of
1 reading
1 more
1 advanced
1 than
1 that
1 which
1 is
1 here
1 presented
1 This
1 consideration
1 has
1 had
1 its
1 full
1 weight
1 in
1 the
1 preparation
1 of
1 the
1 following
1 pages
1 Every
1 exercise
1 will
1 be
1 found
1 to
1 bear
1 the
1 impress
1 of
1 that
1 special
1 adaptation
1 to
1 the
1 purposes
1 of
1 teaching
1 without
1 which
1 no
1 book
1 of
1 this
1 kind
1 can
1 fully
1 perform
1 the
1 office
1 which
1 it
1 assumes
1 The
1 labor
1 expended
1 in
1 this
1 direction
1 though
1 all
1 unseen
1 by
1 the
1 casual
1 observer
1 has
1 been
1 neither
1 light
1 nor
1 brief
1 It
1 can
1 be
1 duly
1 appreciated
1 by
1 none
1 but
1 the
1 experienced
1 teacher
1 All
1 words
1 in
1 the
1 exercises
1 requiring
1 explanation
1 have
1 been
1 arranged
1 as
1 regular
1 lessons
1 in
1 spelling
1 and
1 definition
1 In
1 these
1 definitions
1 however
1 it
1 must
1 be
1 kept
1 in
1 mind
1 that
1 no
1 attempt
1 has
1 been
1 made
1 to
1 give
1 all
1 the
1 meanings
1 of
1 which
1 a
1 word
1 is
1 susceptible
1 but
1 that
1 only
1 which
1 it
1 bears
1 in
1 the
1 particular
1 place
1 in
1 the
1 exercise
1 where
1 it
1 is
1 found
1 There
1 is
1 a
1 special
1 educational
1 advantage
1 in
1 thus
1 leading
1 the
1 mind
1 of
1 the
1 pupil
1 definitely
1 to
1 fix
1 upon
1 the
1 precise
1 import
1 of
1 a
1 word
1 in
1 some
1 particular
1 use
1 or
1 application
1 of
1 it
1 All
1 proper
1 names
1 occurring
1 in
1 the
1 text
1 and
1 at
1 all
1 likely
1 to
1 embarrass
1 the
1 learner
1 have
1 been
1 explained
1 in
1 brief
1 comprehensive
1 notes
1 These
1 notes
1 involve
1 many
1 matters
1 Geographical
1 Biographical
1 and
1 Historical
1 which
1 are
1 not
1 a
1 little
1 interesting
1 in
1 themselves
1 aside
1 from
1 the
1 special
1 purpose
1 subserved
1 by
1 them
1 in
1 the
1 present
1 connection
1 All
1 this
1 has
1 been
1 done
1 and
1 more
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 secure
1 that
1 kind
1 of
1 interest
1 in
1 the
1 exercises
1 which
1 comes
1 of
1 reading
1 what
1 is
1 clearly
1 understood
1 and
1 because
1 no
1 perfect
1 reading
1 is
1 possible
1 where
1 the
1 reader
1 himself
1 fails
1 to
1 perceive
1 the
1 meaning
1 of
1 what
1 he
1 reads
1 In
1 the
1 selection
1 and
1 adaptation
1 of
1 the
1 pieces
1 the
1 highest
1 aim
1 has
1 been
1 to
1 make
1 and
1 to
1 leave
1 the
1 best
1 moral
1 impression
1 and
1 this
1 not
1 by
1 dull
1 and
1 formal
1 teachings
1 but
1 by
1 the
1 pleasanter
1 and
1 therefore
1 more
1 powerful
1 means
1 of
1 incidental
1 and
1 unexpected
1 suggestion
1 Admonition
1 is
1 then
1 most
1 likely
1 to
1 be
1 heeded
1 when
1 it
1 comes
1 through
1 the
1 channel
1 of
1 events
1 and
1 circumstances
1 The
1 direct
1 and
1 ostensible
1 aim
1 of
1 the
1 book
1 however
1 has
1 been
1 kept
1 steadily
1 in
1 view
1 which
1 is
1 to
1 furnish
1 the
1 best
1 possible
1 exercises
1 for
1 practice
1 in
1 Rhetorical
1 reading
1 To
1 this
1 end
1 the
1 greatest
1 variety
1 of
1 style
1 and
1 sentiment
1 has
1 been
1 sought
1 There
1 is
1 scarcely
1 a
1 tone
1 or
1 modulation
1 of
1 which
1 the
1 human
1 voice
1 is
1 capable
1 that
1 finds
1 not
1 here
1 some
1 piece
1 adapted
1 precisely
1 to
1 its
1 best
1 expression
1 There
1 is
1 not
1 an
1 inflection
1 however
1 delicate
1 not
1 an
1 emphasis
1 however
1 slight
1 however
1 strong
1 that
1 does
1 not
1 here
1 meet
1 with
1 something
1 fitted
1 well
1 for
1 its
1 amplest
1 illustration
1 No
1 tenderness
1 of
1 pathos
1 no
1 earnestness
1 of
1 thought
1 no
1 play
1 of
1 wit
1 no
1 burst
1 of
1 passion
1 is
1 there
1 perhaps
1 of
1 which
1 the
1 accomplished
1 teacher
1 of
1 Elocution
1 may
1 not
1 find
1 the
1 proper
1 style
1 of
1 expression
1 in
1 these
1 pages
1 and
1 consequently
1 the
1 best
1 examples
1 for
1 the
1 illustration
1 of
1 his
1 art
1 The
1 book
1 thus
1 briefly
1 described
1 is
1 therefore
1 given
1 to
1 the
1 public
1 with
1 the
1 same
1 confidence
1 that
1 has
1 hitherto
1 inspired
1 the
1 author
1 in
1 similar
1 efforts
1 and
1 with
1 the
1 hope
1 that
1 it
1 may
1 reach
1 even
1 a
1 higher
1 measure
1 of
1 usefulness
1 than
1 that
1 attained
1 by

1 a
1 lesson
1 which
1 I
1 received
1 when
1 quite
1 a
1 young
1 lad
1 while
1 attending
1 an
1 Academy
1 Among
1 my
1 schoolmates
1 were
1 Hartly
1 and
1 Vincent
1 They
1 were
1 both
1 older
1 than
1 myself
1 and
1 Vincent
1 was
1 looked
1 up
1 to
1 as
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 leader
1 in
1 matters
1 of
1 opinion
1 and
1 in
1 directing
1 our
1 sports
1 2
1 He
1 was
1 not
1 at
1 heart
1 a
1 malicious
1 boy
1 but
1 he
1 had
1 a
1 foolish
1 ambition
1 of
1 being
1 thought
1 witty
1 and
1 sarcastic
1 and
1 he
1 made
1 himself
1 feared
1 by
1 a
1 habit
1 of
1 turning
1 things
1 into
1 ridicule
1 He
1 seemed
1 to
1 be
1 constantly
1 looking
1 out
1 for
1 something
1 to
1 occur
1 which
1 he
1 could
1 turn
1 into
1 derision

1 Hartly
1 was
1 a
1 new
1 scholar
1 and
1 little
1 was
1 known
1 of
1 him
1 among
1 the
1 boys
1 One
1 morning
1 as
1 we
1 were
1 on
1 our
1 way
1 to
1 school
1 he
1 was
1 seen
1 driving
1 a
1 cow
1 along
1 the
1 road
1 toward
1 the
1 pasture
1 A
1 group
1 of
1 boys
1 among
1 whom
1 was
1 Vincent
1 met
1 him
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 passing
1 4
1 Now
1 said
1 Vincent
1 let
1 us
1 have
1 a

1 sport
1 with

1 Hartly
1 waved
1 his
1 hand
1 at
1 us
1 with
1 a
1 pleasant
1 smile
1 and
1 driving
1 the
1 cow
1 to
1 the

1 took
1 down
1 the
1 bars
1 of
1 a

1 saw
1 her
1 safely
1 in
1 the

1 and
1 then
1 putting
1 up
1 the
1 bars
1 came
1 and
1 entered
1 the
1 school
1 with
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 us
1 After
1 school
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 he
1 let
1 out
1 the
1 cow
1 and
1 drove
1 her
1 away
1 none
1 of
1 us
1 knew
1 where
1 Every
1 day
1 for
1 two
1 or
1 three
1 weeks
1 he
1 went
1 through
1 the
1 same
1 task
1 6
1 The
1 boys
1 who
1 attended
1 the
1 Academy
1 were
1 nearly
1 all
1 the
1 sons
1 of
1 wealthy
1 parents
1 and
1 some
1 of
1 them
1 were
1 foolish
1 enough
1 to
1 look
1 down
1 with
1 a
1 sort
1 of
1 disdain
1 upon
1 a
1 scholar
1 who
1 had
1 to
1 drive
1 a
1 cow
1 to
1 pasture
1 and
1 the
1 sneers
1 and
1 jeers
1 of
1 Vincent
1 were
1 often
1 repeated
1 7
1 One
1 day
1 he
1 refused
1 to
1 sit
1 next
1 to
1 Hartly
1 in
1 school
1 on
1 a
1 pretense
1 that
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 like
1 the
1 odor
1 of
1 the
1 barn
1 Sometimes
1 he
1 would
1 inquire
1 of
1 Hartly
1 after
1 the
1 cow
1 s
1 health
1 pronouncing
1 the
1 word
1 ke
1 -ow
1 after
1 the
1 manner
1 of
1 some
1 people
1 8
1 Hartly
1 bore
1 all
1 these
1 silly
1 attempts
1 to
1 wound
1 his
1 feelings
1 and
1 annoy
1 him
1 with
1 the
1 utmost
1 good
1 nature
1 He
1 never
1 once
1 returned
1 an
1 angry
1 look
1 or
1 word
1 One
1 time
1 Vincent
1 said
1 Hartly
1 I
1 suppose
1 your
1 father
1 intends
1 to
1 make
1 a
1 milkman
1 of
1 you
1 9
1 hy
1 not
1 said
1 Hartly
1 Oh
1 nothing
1 said
1 Vincent
1 only
1 do
1 not
1 leave
1 much
1 water
1 in
1 the
1 cans
1 after
1 rinsing
1 them
1 -
1 -that
1 s
1 all
1 The
1 boys
1 laughed
1 and
1 Hartly
1 not
1 in
1 the
1 least
1 mortified
1 replied
1 Never
1 fear
1 if
1 I
1 ever
1 rise
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 milkman
1 I
1 will
1 give

1 measure
1 and

1 A
1 few
1 days
1 after
1 this
1 conversation
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 public
1 exhibition
1 at
1 which
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 ladies
1 and
1 gentlemen
1 from
1 the
1 city
1 was
1 present
1 Prizes
1 were
1 awarded
1 by
1 the
1 Principal
1 of
1 the
1 Academy
1 and
1 Hartly
1 and
1 Vincent
1 each
1 received
1 one
1 for
1 in
1 respect
1 to
1 scholarship
1 they
1 were
1 about
1 equal
1 1
1 1
1 After
1 the
1 prizes
1 were
1 distributed
1 the
1 Principal
1 remarked
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 one
1 prize
1 consisting
1 of
1 a
1 medal
1 which
1 was
1 rarely
1 awarded
1 not
1 so
1 much
1 on
1 account
1 of
1 its
1 great
1 value
1 as
1 because
1 the
1 instances
1 are
1 rare
1 that
1 merit
1 it
1 It
1 is
1 THE
1 PRIZE
1 FOR
1 HEROISM
1 The
1 last
1 boy
1 on
1 whom
1 it
1 was
1 conferred
1 was
1 Master
1 Manners
1 who
1 three
1 years
1 ago
1 rescued
1 the
1 blind
1 girl
1 from
1 drowning
1 1
1 2
1 The
1 Principal
1 then
1 said
1 ith
1 the
1 permission
1 of
1 the
1 company
1 I
1 will
1 relate
1 a
1 short
1 story
1 Not
1 long
1 since
1 some
1 boys
1 were
1 flying
1 a
1 kite
1 in
1 the
1 street
1 just
1 as
1 a
1 poor
1 boy
1 on
1 horseback
1 rode
1 by
1 on
1 his
1 way
1 to
1 mill
1 The
1 horse
1 took
1 fright
1 and
1 threw
1 the
1 boy
1 injuring
1 him
1 so
1 badly
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 carried
1 home
1 and
1 confined
1 for
1 some
1 weeks
1 to
1 his
1 bed
1 1
1 3
1 None
1 of
1 the
1 boys
1 who
1 had
1 caused
1 the
1 disaster
1 followed
1 to
1 learn
1 the
1 fate
1 of
1 the
1 wounded
1 boy
1 There
1 was
1 one
1 however
1 who
1 witnessed
1 the
1 accident
1 from
1 a
1 distance
1 and
1 went
1 to
1 render
1 what
1 service
1 he
1 could
1 He
1 soon
1 learned
1 that
1 the
1 wounded
1 boy
1 was
1 the
1 grandson
1 of
1 a
1 poor
1 widow
1 whose
1 only
1 support
1 consisted
1 in
1 selling
1 the
1 milk
1 of
1 a
1 fine
1 cow
1 of
1 which
1 she
1 was
1 the
1 owner
1 1
1 4
1 Alas
1 what
1 could
1 she
1 now
1 do
1 She
1 was
1 old
1 and
1 lame
1 and
1 her
1 grandson
1 on
1 whom
1 she
1 depended
1 to
1 drive
1 the
1 cow
1 to
1 pasture
1 was
1 now
1 sick
1 and
1 helpless
1 Never
1 mind
1 good
1 woman
1 said
1 the
1 boy
1 I
1 can
1 drive
1 your
1 cow
1 ith
1 thanks
1 the
1 poor
1 widow
1 accepted
1 his
1 offer
1 1
1 5
1 But
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 kindness
1 did
1 not
1 stop
1 here
1 Money
1 was
1 wanted
1 to
1 purchase
1 medicine
1 I
1 have
1 money
1 that
1 my
1 mother
1 sent
1 me
1 to
1 buy
1 a
1 pair
1 of
1 boots
1 said
1 the
1 boy
1 but
1 I
1 can
1 do
1 without
1 them
1 for
1 the
1 present
1 1
1 6
1 Oh
1 no
1 said
1 the
1 old
1 lady
1 I
1 can
1 not
1 consent
1 to
1 that
1 but
1 here
1 is
1 a
1 pair
1 of
1 cowhide
1 boots
1 that
1 I
1 bought
1 for
1 Henry
1 who
1 can
1 not
1 wear
1 them
1 If
1 you
1 will
1 buy
1 them
1 giving
1 me
1 what
1 they
1 cost
1 I
1 can
1 get
1 along
1 very
1 well
1 The
1 boy
1 bought
1 the
1 boots
1 clumsy
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 and
1 has
1 worn
1 them
1 up
1 to
1 this
1 time
1 1
1 7
1 hen
1 the
1 other
1 boys
1 of
1 the
1 Academy
1 saw
1 this
1 scholar
1 driving
1 a
1 cow
1 to
1 the
1 pasture
1 he
1 was
1 assailed
1 with
1 laughter
1 and
1 ridicule
1 His
1 thick
1 cowhide
1 boots
1 in
1 particular
1 were
1 made
1 matters
1 of
1 mirth
1 But
1 he
1 kept
1 on
1 cheerfully
1 and
1 bravely
1 day
1 after
1 day
1 driving
1 the
1 widow
1 s
1 cow
1 to
1 the
1 pasture
1 and
1 wearing
1 his
1 thick
1 boots
1 contented
1 in
1 the
1 thought
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 doing
1 right
1 not
1 caring
1 for
1 all
1 the
1 jeers
1 and
1 sneers
1 that
1 could
1 be
1 uttered
1 1
1 8
1 He
1 never
1 undertook
1 to
1 explain
1 why
1 he
1 drove
1 the
1 cow
1 for
1 he
1 was
1 not
1 inclined
1 to
1 display
1 his
1 charitable
1 motives
1 and
1 besides
1 in
1 heart
1 he
1 had
1 no
1 sympathy
1 with
1 the
1 false
1 pride
1 that
1 looks
1 with
1 ridicule
1 on
1 any
1 useful
1 employment
1 It
1 was
1 by
1 mere
1 accident
1 that
1 his
1 course
1 of
1 conduct
1 and
1 self
1 -denial
1 was
1 yesterday
1 discovered
1 by
1 his
1 teacher
1 1
1 9
1 And
1 now
1 ladies
1 and
1 gentlemen
1 I
1 appeal
1 to
1 you
1 as
1 there
1 not
1 true
1 heroism
1 in
1 this
1 boy
1 s
1 conduct
1 Nay
1 Master
1 Hartly
1 do
1 not
1 steal
1 out
1 of
1 sight
1 behind
1 the
1 blackboard
1 You
1 were
1 not
1 ashamed
1 of
1 ridicule
1 -
1 -you
1 must
1 not
1 shun
1 praise
1 Come
1 forth
1 come
1 forth
1 Master
1 Edward
1 James
1 Hartly
1 and
1 let
1 us
1 see
1 your
1 honest
1 face
1 2
1 0
1 As
1 Hartly
1 with
1 blushing
1 cheeks
1 made
1 his
1 appearance
1 the
1 whole
1 company
1 greeted
1 him
1 with
1 a
1 round
1 of
1 applause
1 for
1 his
1 heroic
1 conduct
1 The
1 ladies
1 stood
1 upon
1 benches
1 and
1 waved
1 their
1 handkerchiefs
1 The
1 old
1 men
1 clapped
1 their
1 hands
1 and
1 wiped
1 the
1 moisture
1 from
1 the
1 corners
1 of
1 their
1 eyes
1 Those
1 clumsy
1 boots
1 on
1 Hartly
1 s
1 feet
1 seemed
1 prouder
1 ornaments
1 than
1 a
1 crown
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 on
1 his
1 head
1 The
1 medal
1 was
1 bestowed
1 on
1 him
1 amid
1 the
1 applause
1 of
1 the
1 whole
1 company
1 2
1 1
1 Vincent
1 was
1 heartily
1 ashamed
1 of
1 his
1 ill
1 -natured
1 sneers
1 and
1 after
1 the
1 school
1 was
1 dismissed
1 he
1 went
1 with
1 tears
1 in
1 his
1 eyes
1 and
1 tendered
1 his
1 hand
1 to
1 Hartly
1 making
1 a
1 handsome
1 apology
1 for
1 his
1 past
1 ill
1 manners
1 Think
1 no
1 more
1 about
1 it
1 said
1 Hartly
1 let
1 us
1 all
1 go
1 and
1 have
1 a
1 ramble
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 before
1 we
1 break
1 up
1 for
1 vacation
1 The
1 boys
1 one
1 and
1 all
1 followed
1 Vincent
1 s
1 example
1 and
1 then
1 with
1 shouts
1 and
1 huzzas
1 they
1 all
1 set
1 forth
1 into
1 the

1 1
1 Many
1 years
1 ago
1 dining
1 the
1 early
1 settlements
1 in
1 New
1 England
1 the
1 children
1 were
1 accustomed
1 to
1 gather
1 large
1 quantities
1 of
1 nuts
1 which
1 grew
1 in
1 great
1 abundance
1 in
1 the
1 forests
1 that
1 surrounded
1 their
1 little
1 plantations
1 2
1 In
1 one
1 of
1 these
1 nut
1 -gatherings
1 a
1 little
1 boy
1 and
1 girl
1 the
1 one
1 eight
1 and
1 the
1 other
1 four
1 years
1 of
1 age
1 whose
1 mother
1 was
1 dead
1 became
1 separated
1 from
1 their
1 companions
1 On
1 their
1 way
1 home
1 they
1 came
1 across
1 some
1 wild
1 grapes
1 and
1 were
1 busily
1 engaged
1 in
1 gathering
1 them
1 till
1 the
1 last
1 rays
1 of
1 the
1 setting
1 sun
1 were
1 fading
1 away
1 3
1 Suddenly
1 they
1 were
1 seized
1 by
1 two
1 Indians
1 The
1 boy
1 struggled
1 violently
1 and
1 his
1 little
1 sister
1 cried
1 to
1 him
1 for
1 protection
1 but
1 in
1 vain
1 The
1 Indians
1 soon
1 bore
1 them
1 far
1 beyond
1 the
1 bounds
1 of
1 the
1 settlement
1 Night
1 was
1 far
1 advanced
1 before
1 they
1 halted
1 Then
1 they
1 kindled
1 a
1 fire
1 and
1 offered
1 the
1 children
1 some
1 food
1 4
1 The
1 heart
1 of
1 the
1 boy
1 swelled
1 high
1 with
1 grief
1 and
1 anger
1 and
1 he
1 refused
1 to
1 eat
1 But
1 the
1 poor
1 little
1 girl
1 took
1 some
1 parched
1 corn
1 from
1 the
1 hand
1 of
1 the
1 Indian
1 who
1 held
1 her
1 on
1 his
1 knee
1 He
1 smiled
1 as
1 he
1 saw
1 her
1 eat
1 the
1 kernels
1 and
1 look
1 up
1 in
1 his
1 face
1 with
1 a
1 wondering
1 yet
1 reproachful
1 eye
1 Then
1 they
1 lay
1 down
1 to
1 sleep
1 in
1 the
1 dark
1 forest
1 each
1 with
1 an
1 arm
1 over
1 his
1 little
1 captive
1 5
1 Great
1 was
1 the
1 alarm
1 in
1 the
1 colony
1 when
1 these
1 children
1 did
1 not
1 return
1 Every
1 spot
1 was
1 searched
1 where
1 it
1 was
1 thought
1 possible
1 they
1 might
1 have
1 lost
1 their
1 way
1 But
1 when
1 at
1 length
1 their
1 little
1 basket
1 was
1 found
1 overturned
1 in
1 a
1 tangled
1 thicket
1 they
1 came
1 to
1 the
1 conclusion
1 that
1 they
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 captured
1 by
1 the
1 Indians
1 6
1 It
1 was
1 decided
1 that
1 before
1 any
1 warlike
1 measures
1 were
1 adopted
1 the
1 father
1 should
1 go
1 peacefully
1 to
1 the
1 Indian
1 king
1 and
1 demand
1 his
1 children
1 At
1 the
1 earliest
1 dawn
1 of
1 morning
1 he
1 departed
1 with
1 his
1 companions
1 They
1 met
1 a
1 friendly
1 Indian
1 pursuing
1 the
1 chase
1 who
1 consented
1 to
1 be
1 their
1 guide
1 7
1 They
1 traveled
1 through
1 rude
1 paths
1 until
1 the
1 day
1 drew
1 near
1 a
1 close
1 Then
1 approaching
1 a
1 circle
1 of
1 native
1 dwellings
1 in
1 the
1 midst
1 of
1 which
1 was
1 a
1 tent
1 they
1 saw
1 a
1 man
1 of
1 lofty
1 form
1 with
1 a
1 coronet
1 of
1 feathers
1 upon
1 his
1 brow
1 and
1 surrounded
1 by
1 warriors
1 The
1 guide
1 saluted
1 him
1 as
1 his
1 monarch
1 and
1 the
1 bereaved
1 father
1 bowing
1 down
1 thus
1 addressed

1 But
1 I
1 was

1 And

1 1
1 3
1 I
1 looked

1 I

1 I
1 was
1 but
1 five
1 years
1 old
1 when
1 my
1 mother
1 died
1 but
1 her
1 image
1 is
1 as
1 fresh
1 in
1 my
1 mind
1 now
1 that
1 twenty
1 years
1 have
1 elapsed
1 as
1 it
1 was
1 at
1 the
1 time
1 of
1 her
1 death
1 I
1 remember
1 her
1 as
1 a
1 pale
1 gentle
1 being
1 with
1 a
1 sweet
1 smile
1 and
1 a
1 voice
1 soft
1 and
1 cheerful
1 when
1 she
1 praised
1 me
1 and
1 when
1 I
1 had
1 erred
1 for
1 I
1 was
1 a
1 wild
1 thoughtless
1 child
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 mild
1 and
1 tender
1 earnestness
1 in
1 her
1 reproofs
1 that
1 always
1 went
1 to
1 my
1 little
1 heart
1 2
1 Methinks
1 I
1 can
1 now
1 see
1 her
1 large
1 blue
1 eyes
1 moist
1 with
1 sorrow
1 because
1 of
1 my
1 childish
1 waywardness
1 and
1 hear
1 her
1 repeat
1 My
1 child
1 how
1 can
1 you
1 grieve
1 me
1 so
1 She
1 had
1 for
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 been
1 pale
1 and
1 feeble
1 and
1 sometimes
1 there
1 would
1 come
1 a
1 bright
1 spot
1 on
1 her
1 cheek
1 which
1 made
1 her
1 look
1 so
1 lovely
1 I
1 thought
1 she
1 must
1 be
1 well
1 But
1 then
1 she
1 spoke
1 of
1 dying
1 and
1 pressed
1 me
1 to
1 her
1 bosom
1 and
1 told
1 me
1 to
1 be
1 good
1 when
1 she
1 was
1 gone
1 and
1 to
1 love
1 my
1 father
1 and
1 be
1 kind
1 to
1 him
1 for
1 he
1 would
1 have
1 no
1 one
1 else
1 to
1 love
1 3
1 I
1 recollect
1 she
1 was
1 ill
1 all
1 day
1 and
1 my
1 little
1 hobbyhorse
1 and
1 whip
1 were
1 laid
1 aside
1 and
1 I
1 tried
1 to
1 be
1 very
1 quiet
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 see
1 her
1 for
1 the
1 whole
1 day
1 and
1 it
1 seemed
1 very
1 long
1 At
1 night
1 they
1 told
1 me
1 my
1 mother
1 was
1 too
1 sick
1 to
1 kiss
1 me
1 as
1 she
1 always
1 had
1 done
1 before
1 I
1 went
1 to
1 bed
1 and
1 I
1 must
1 go
1 without
1 it
1 But
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 I
1 stole
1 into
1 the
1 room
1 and
1 placing
1 my
1 lips
1 close
1 to
1 hers
1 whispered
1 Mother
1 dear
1 mother
1 won
1 t
1 you
1 kiss
1 me
1 4
1 Her
1 lips
1 were
1 very
1 cold
1 and
1 when
1 she
1 put
1 her
1 hand
1 upon
1 my
1 cheek
1 and
1 laid
1 my
1 head
1 on
1 her
1 bosom
1 I
1 felt
1 a
1 cold
1 shuddering
1 pass
1 all
1 through
1 me
1 My
1 father
1 carried
1 me
1 from
1 the
1 room
1 but
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 speak
1 After
1 they
1 put
1 me
1 in
1 bed
1 I
1 lay
1 a
1 long
1 while
1 thinking
1 I
1 feared
1 my
1 mother
1 would
1 indeed
1 die
1 for
1 her
1 cheek
1 felt
1 cold
1 as
1 my
1 little
1 sister
1 s
1 did
1 when
1 she
1 died
1 and
1 they
1 carried
1 her
1 little
1 body
1 away
1 where
1 I
1 never
1 saw
1 it
1 again
1 But
1 I
1 soon
1 fell
1 asleep
1 5
1 In
1 the
1 morning
1 I
1 rushed
1 to
1 my
1 mother
1 s
1 room
1 with
1 a
1 strange
1 dread
1 of
1 evil
1 to
1 come
1 upon
1 me
1 It
1 was
1 just
1 as
1 I
1 feared
1 A
1 white
1 linen
1 covered
1 her
1 straight
1 cold
1 form
1 I
1 removed
1 it
1 from
1 her
1 face
1 her
1 eyes
1 were
1 closed
1 and
1 her
1 cheeks
1 were
1 hard
1 and
1 cold
1 But
1 my
1 mother
1 s
1 dear
1 dear
1 smile
1 was
1 there
1 or
1 my
1 heart
1 would
1 have
1 broken

1 In
1 an
1 instant
1 all
1 the
1 little
1 faults
1 for
1 which
1 she
1 had
1 so
1 often
1 reproved
1 me
1 rushed
1 upon
1 my
1 mind
1 I
1 longed
1 to
1 tell
1 her
1 how
1 good
1 I
1 would
1 always
1 be
1 if
1 she
1 would
1 but
1 stay
1 with
1 me
1 I
1 longed
1 to
1 tell
1 her
1 how
1 in
1 all
1 time
1 to
1 come
1 her
1 words
1 would
1 be
1 a
1 law
1 to
1 me
1 I
1 would
1 be
1 all
1 that
1 she
1 had
1 wished
1 me
1 to

1 was

1 headstrong
1 boy
1 and
1 never
1 did
1 this
1 frame
1 of
1 temper
1 come
1 upon
1 me
1 but
1 I
1 seemed
1 to
1 see
1 her
1 mild
1 tearful
1 eyes
1 full
1 upon
1 me
1 just
1 as
1 she
1 used
1 to
1 look
1 in
1 life
1 and
1 when
1 I
1 strove
1 for
1 the
1 mastery
1 over
1 my
1 passions
1 her
1 smile
1 seemed
1 to
1 cheer
1 my
1 heart
1 and
1 I
1 was
1 happy
1 8
1 My
1 whole
1 character
1 underwent
1 a
1 change
1 even
1 from
1 the
1 moment
1 of
1 her
1 death
1 Her
1 spirit
1 seemed
1 to

1 to
1 aid
1 the
1 good
1 and
1 root
1 out
1 the
1 evil
1 that
1 was
1 in
1 me
1 I
1 felt
1 it
1 would

1 I

1 even
1 on
1 the

1 neatly
1 dressed
1 boy
1 twelve
1 or
1 thirteen
1 years
1 of

1 of
1 a
1 clerk
1 as
1 he
1 stood
1 by
1 the
1 counter
1 of
1 a
1 large
1 bookstore
1 The
1 clerk
1 regarded
1 the
1 boy
1 with
1 a
1 haughty
1 look
1 and
1 answered
1 Mr
1 Harris
1 is
1 in
1 but
1 he
1 is

1 2
1 The
1 boy
1 looked
1 at
1 the

1 hesitatingly
1 and
1 then
1 said
1 If

1 I

1 man
1 stepping
1 up
1 to
1 the

1 what
1 does
1 the

1 He
1 insisted
1 on
1 seeing
1 you
1 though
1 I
1 told
1 him
1 you
1 were

1 returned
1 the
1 clerk
1 a
1 little
1 abashed
1 by
1 the
1 manner
1 of
1 his
1 employer
1 4
1 And
1 what
1 do
1 you
1 wish

1 inquired

1 The

1 raised
1 his

1 and
1 meeting
1 the
1 scornful
1 glance
1 of
1 the
1 clerk
1 said
1 timidly
1 I
1 wish
1 you
1 to
1 look
1 at
1 the
1 bill
1 of
1 some
1 books
1 which
1 I
1 bought
1 here
1 about

1 There
1 is

1 5
1 Ah

1 see
1 replied

1 I

1 No
1 sir
1 answered
1 the
1 boy
1 On
1 the
1 contrary
1 I
1 purchased
1 some
1 books
1 which
1 are
1 not
1 charged
1 in
1 the

1 and
1 I
1 have
1 called
1 to

1 for

1 Mr

1 looked
1 at
1 the
1 boy
1 earnestly
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 and
1 then
1 asked
1 hen
1 did
1 you
1 discover

1 replied

1 hen
1 I
1 paid
1 for
1 the
1 books
1 I
1 was
1 in

1 did

1 asked
1 the

1 in
1 a

1 the

1 One
1 of

1 a

1 had

1 when

1 and
1 petted
1 by
1 a
1 young
1 lady
1 in
1 the
1 village
1 until
1 it
1 became
1 completely
1 domesticated
1 2
1 It
1 was
1 graceful
1 as
1 those
1 little
1 creatures
1 always
1 are
1 and
1 so
1 gentle
1 and
1 playful
1 that

1 Following

1 about
1 it
1 was
1 caressed
1 and
1 welcomed
1 everywhere
1 One
1 morning
1 after
1 gamboling
1 about
1 as
1 usual
1 until
1 weary
1 it
1 threw
1 itself
1 down
1 in
1 the

1 at
1 the
1 feet
1 of

1 of

1 upon

1 of

1 There
1 came
1 along
1 a
1 countryman
1 who
1 for
1 several
1 years
1 had
1 been
1 a
1 hunter
1 by
1 pursuit
1 and
1 who
1 still
1 kept
1 several
1 hounds
1 one
1 of
1 which
1 came
1 to
1 the
1 village
1 with
1 him
1 on
1 this

1 The
1 dog
1 as

1 4
1 It
1 had

1 life
1 among

1 villagers
1 and
1 had
1 apparently
1 lost
1 all

1 but
1 it
1 now
1 seemed
1 to
1 know
1 instinctively
1 that

1 of

1 and
1 before
1 its

1 could
1 secure
1 it
1 the
1 fawn
1 was
1 leaping
1 wildly
1 through
1 the

1 the
1 hound
1 in
1 full
1 chase
1 The
1 by

1 instantly

1 were
1 calling
1 the
1 name
1 it

1 hitherto
1 known
1 but
1 in

1 6
1 The
1 hunter
1 endeavored
1 to
1 call
1 back
1 his
1 dog
1 but
1 with
1 no
1 better
1 success
1 In
1 half
1 a
1 minute
1 the
1 fawn
1 had
1 turned
1 the
1 first
1 corner
1 dashed
1 onward
1 toward
1 the
1 lake
1 and
1 thrown
1 itself
1 into

1 the
1 startled
1 creature
1 believed

1 safe
1 in
1 the
1 lake
1 it
1 was
1 soon
1 undeceived
1 for
1 the
1 hound
1 followed
1 in
1 hot
1 and
1 eager
1 chase
1 while
1 a
1 dozen
1 village
1 dogs
1 joined
1 in
1 the

1 A

1 collected
1 on

1 and
1 children
1 -
1 -anxious
1 for
1 the

1 of
1 the
1 little
1 animal
1 Some
1 threw
1 themselves
1 into
1 boats
1 hoping
1 to
1 intercept
1 the
1 hound
1 before
1 he
1 reached
1 his
1 prey
1 But
1 the
1 splashing
1 of
1 the
1 oars
1 the
1 voices
1 of
1 men
1 and
1 boys
1 and
1 the
1 barking
1 of
1 the
1 dogs
1 must
1 have
1 filled
1 the
1 beating
1 heart
1 of
1 the
1 poor
1 fawn
1 with
1 terror
1 and
1 anguish
1 as
1 if
1 every
1 creature
1 on
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 it
1 had
1 once
1 been
1 caressed
1 and
1 fondled
1 had
1 suddenly
1 turned
1 into
1 a
1 deadly
1 foe
1 8
1 It
1 was
1 soon
1 seen
1 that
1 the
1 fawn
1 was
1 directing
1 its
1 course
1 across
1 a
1 bay
1 toward
1 the
1 nearest
1 borders
1 of
1 the
1 forest
1 Immediately
1 the
1 owner
1 of
1 the
1 hound
1 crossed
1 the
1 bridge
1 ran
1 at
1 full
1 speed
1 in
1 the

1 direction
1 hoping
1 to
1 stop

1 dog
1 as
1 he
1 landed
1 On
1 swam
1 the
1 fawn
1 as
1 it
1 had
1 never
1 swam
1 before
1 its
1 delicate
1 head
1 scarcely
1 seen
1 above
1 the
1 water
1 but
1 leaving
1 a
1 disturbed
1 track
1 which
1 betrayed
1 its
1 course
1 alike
1 to

1 friends

1 Ebenezer
1 ebster
1 the
1 father
1 of
1 Daniel
1 was
1 a
1 farmer
1 The
1 vegetables
1 in
1 his
1 garden
1 had
1 suffered
1 considerably
1 from
1 the
1 depredations
1 of
1 a
1 woodchuck
1 which
1 had
1 his
1 hole
1 or
1 habitation
1 near
1 the
1 premises
1 Daniel
1 some
1 ten
1 or
1 twelve
1 years
1 old
1 and
1 his
1 older
1 brother
1 Ezekiel
1 had
1 set
1 a
1 trap
1 and
1 finally
1 succeeded
1 in
1 capturing
1 the
1 trespasser
1 2
1 Ezekiel
1 proposed
1 to
1 kill
1 the
1 animal
1 and
1 end
1 at

1 trouble
1 from

1 Daniel
1 looked
1 with
1 compassion
1 upon
1 his
1 meek
1 dumb
1 captive
1 and
1 offered
1 to
1 let
1 him
1 again
1 go
1 free
1 The
1 boys
1 could
1 not
1 agree
1 and
1 they
1 appealed
1 to
1 their
1 father
1 to
1 decide
1 the
1 case
1 3
1 ell
1 my
1 boys
1 said
1 the
1 old
1 gentleman
1 I
1 will
1 be
1 the
1 judge
1 There
1 is
1 the
1 prisoner
1 pointing
1 to
1 the

1 -chuck
1 and
1 you
1 shall
1 be
1 the

1 and
1 plead
1 the
1 case
1 for
1 and
1 against
1 his
1 life
1 and
1 liberty
1 4
1 Ezekiel
1 opened
1 the
1 case
1 with
1 a
1 strong
1 argument
1 urging
1 the
1 mischievous
1 nature
1 of
1 the
1 criminal
1 the
1 great
1 harm
1 he
1 had
1 already
1 done
1 said
1 that
1 much
1 time
1 and
1 labor
1 had
1 been
1 spent
1 in
1 his
1 capture
1 and
1 now
1 if
1 he
1 were
1 suffered
1 to
1 live
1 and
1 go
1 again
1 at
1 large
1 he
1 would
1 renew
1 his
1 depredations
1 and
1 be
1 cunning
1 enough
1 not
1 to
1 suffer
1 himself
1 to
1 be
1 caught
1 again
1 5
1 He
1 urged
1 further
1 that
1 his
1 skin
1 was
1 of
1 some
1 value
1 and
1 that
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 most
1 of
1 him
1 they
1 could
1 it
1 would
1 not
1 repay
1 half
1 the
1 damage
1 he
1 had
1 already
1 done
1 His
1 argument
1 was
1 ready
1 practical
1 to
1 the
1 point
1 and
1 of
1 much
1 greater
1 length
1 than
1 our

1 will

1 to

1 story

1 The
1 father
1 looked
1 with
1 pride
1 upon
1 his
1 son
1 who
1 became
1 a
1 distinguished
1 jurist
1 in
1 his
1 manhood
1 Now
1 Daniel
1 it
1 is
1 your
1 turn
1 I
1 ll
1 hear
1 what
1 you
1 have
1 to
1 say
1 7
1 It
1 was
1 his
1 first
1 case
1 Daniel
1 saw
1 that
1 the
1 plea
1 of
1 his
1 brother
1 had
1 sensibly
1 affected
1 his
1 father
1 the
1 judge
1 and
1 as
1 his
1 large
1 brilliant
1 black
1 eyes
1 looked
1 upon
1 the
1 soft
1 timid
1 expression
1 of
1 the
1 animal
1 and
1 he
1 saw
1 it
1 tremble
1 with
1 fear
1 in
1 its
1 narrow
1 prison
1 -house
1 his
1 heart
1 swelled
1 with
1 pity
1 and
1 he
1 urged
1 with
1 eloquent
1 words
1 that
1 the
1 captive
1 might
1 again
1 go
1 free
1 8
1 God
1 he
1 said
1 had
1 made
1 the
1 woodchuck
1 he
1 made
1 him
1 to
1 live
1 to
1 enjoy
1 the
1 bright
1 sunlight
1 the
1 pure
1 air
1 the
1 free
1 fields
1 and
1 woods
1 God
1 had
1 not
1 made
1 him
1 or
1 any
1 thing
1 in
1 vain
1 the
1 woodchuck
1 had
1 as
1 much
1 right
1 to
1 life
1 as
1 any
1 other
1 living
1 thing
1 9
1 He
1 was
1 not
1 a
1 destructive
1 animal
1 as
1 the
1 wolf
1 and
1 the
1 fox
1 were
1 he
1 simply
1 ate
1 a
1 few
1 common
1 vegetables
1 of
1 which
1 they
1 had
1 plenty
1 and
1 could
1 well
1 spare
1 a
1 part
1 he
1 destroyed
1 nothing
1 except
1 the
1 little
1 food
1 he
1 needed
1 to
1 sustain
1 his
1 humble
1 life
1 and
1 that
1 little
1 food
1 was
1 as
1 sweet
1 to
1 him
1 and
1 as
1 necessary
1 to
1 his
1 existence
1 as
1 was
1 to
1 them
1 the
1 food
1 upon
1 their
1 mother
1 s
1 table
1 1
1 0
1 God
1 furnished
1 to
1 them

1 he
1 gave
1 them
1 all
1 they
1 possessed
1 and
1 would
1 they
1 not
1 spare
1 a
1 little
1 for
1 the
1 dumb
1 creature
1 that
1 really
1 had
1 as
1 much
1 right
1 to
1 his
1 small
1 share
1 of
1 God
1 s
1 bounty
1 as
1 they
1 themselves
1 had
1 to
1 their
1 portion
1 1
1 1
1 Yea
1 more
1 the
1 animal
1 had
1 never
1 violated
1 the
1 laws
1 of
1 his
1 nature
1 or
1 the
1 laws
1 of
1 God
1 as
1 man
1 often
1 did
1 but
1 strictly
1 followed
1 the
1 simple
1 harmless
1 instincts
1 he
1 had
1 received
1 from
1 the
1 hand
1 of
1 the
1 Creator
1 of
1 all
1 things
1 Created
1 by
1 God
1 s

1 he
1 had
1 a

1 -a
1 right
1 from
1 God
1 -
1 -to
1 life
1 to
1 food
1 to

1 and
1 they
1 had
1 no
1 right
1 to
1 deprive
1 him
1 of
1 either
1 1
1 2
1 He
1 alluded
1 to
1 the
1 mute
1 but
1 earnest
1 pleadings
1 of
1 the
1 animal
1 for
1 that
1 life
1 as
1 sweet
1 as
1 dear
1 to
1 him
1 as
1 their
1 own
1 was
1 to
1 them
1 and
1 the
1 just
1 judgment
1 they
1 might
1 expect
1 if
1 in
1 selfish
1 cruelty
1 and
1 cold
1 heartlessness
1 they
1 took
1 the
1 life
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 restore
1 -
1 -the
1 life
1 that
1 God
1 alone
1 had

1 1
1 3
1 During
1 this
1 appeal
1 the
1 tears
1 had
1 started
1 to
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 s
1 eyes
1 and
1 were
1 fast
1 running
1 down
1 his
1 sun
1 -burnt
1 cheeks
1 every
1 feeling
1 of
1 a
1 father
1 s
1 heart
1 was
1 stirred
1 within
1 him
1 he
1 saw
1 the
1 future
1 greatness
1 of
1 his
1 son
1 before
1 his

1 of

1 1

1 His
1 pity
1 and

1 were
1 awakened
1 by
1 the
1 eloquent
1 words
1 of
1 compassion
1 and
1 the

1 for

1 How

1 And

1 he

1 He

1 He

1 One

1 the

1 of

1 mood
1 they
1 started
1 out
1 from

1 sail
1 on
1 a

1 There
1 was

1 as
1 they
1 put
1 off
1 and
1 they
1 darted
1 through
1 the

1 The

1 the
1 progress
1 of
1 his
1 little
1 son
1 with
1 a
1 great
1 degree
1 of
1 pride
1 and
1 when
1 he
1 saw
1 him
1 drop
1 behind
1 he
1 leaped
1 upon
1 the
1 quarter
1 -deck
1 and
1 was
1 just
1 upon
1 the
1 point
1 of
1 urging
1 him
1 on
1 by
1 a
1 shout
1 when
1 a
1 cry
1 was
1 heard
1 that
1 struck
1 him
1 with
1 instant
1 horror
1 6
1 A
1 shark
1 a
1 shark
1 was
1 sounded
1 from
1 the
1 captain
1 of
1 the
1 forecastle
1 and
1 at
1 the
1 sound
1 of
1 these
1 terrible
1 words
1 the
1 men
1 who
1 were
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 leaped
1 and
1 plunged
1 toward
1 the
1 ship
1 Right
1 abeam
1 at
1 the
1 distance
1 of
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 cables
1 lengths
1 was
1 seen
1 the
1 wake
1 of
1 a
1 shark
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 where
1 the
1 back
1 of
1 the
1 monster
1 was
1 visible
1 His
1 course
1 was
1 for
1 the
1 boys
1 7
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 the
1 gunner
1 stood
1 like
1 one
1 bereft
1 of
1 reason
1 but
1 on
1 the
1 next
1 he
1 shouted
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 his
1 voice
1 for
1 the
1 boys
1 to
1 turn
1 but
1 they
1 heard
1 him
1 not
1 Stoutly
1 the
1 two
1 swimmers
1 strove
1 for
1 the
1 goal
1 all
1 unconscious
1 of
1 their
1 imminent
1 danger
1 Their
1 merry
1 laugh
1 still
1 rang
1 over
1 the
1 waters
1 and
1 at
1 length
1 they
1 both
1 touched
1 the
1 buoy
1 together
1 8
1 Oh
1 what
1 agony
1 filled
1 the
1 heart
1 of
1 the
1 gunner
1 A
1 boat
1 had
1 put
1 off
1 but
1 he
1 knew
1 that
1 it
1 could
1 not
1 reach
1 the
1 boys
1 in
1 season
1 and
1 every
1 moment
1 he
1 expected
1 to
1 see
1 the
1 monster
1 sink
1 from
1 sight
1 -
1 -then
1 he
1 knew
1 that
1 all
1 hope
1 would
1 be
1 gone
1 At
1 this
1 moment
1 a
1 cry
1 reached
1 the
1 ship
1 that
1 pierced
1 every
1 heart
1 -
1 -the
1 boys
1 had
1 discovered
1 their
1 enemy
1 9
1 The
1 cry
1 started
1 the
1 old
1 gunner
1 to
1 his
1 senses
1 and
1 quicker
1 than
1 thought
1 he
1 sprang
1 from
1 the
1 quarter
1 -deck
1 The
1 guns
1 were
1 all
1 loaded
1 and
1 shotted
1 fore
1 and
1 aft
1 and
1 none
1 knew
1 their
1 temper
1 better
1 than
1 he
1 ith
1 steady
1 hand
1 made
1 strong
1 by
1 sudden
1 hope
1 the
1 old
1 gunner
1 seized
1 a
1 priming
1 -wire
1 and
1 picked
1 the
1 cartridge
1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 quarter
1 guns
1 then
1 he
1 took
1 from
1 his
1 pocket
1 a
1 percussion
1 cap
1 fixed
1 it
1 in
1 its
1 place
1 and
1 set
1 back
1 the
1 hammer
1 of
1 the
1 patent
1 lock
1 1
1 0
1 ith
1 a
1 giant
1 strength
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 swayed
1 the
1 breech
1 of
1 the
1 heavy
1 gun
1 to
1 its
1 bearing
1 and
1 then
1 seizing
1 the
1 string
1 of
1 the
1 lock
1 he
1 stood
1 back
1 and
1 watched
1 for
1 the
1 next
1 swell
1 that
1 would
1 bring
1 the
1 shark
1 in
1 range
1 He
1 had
1 aimed
1 the
1 piece
1 some
1 distance
1 ahead
1 of
1 his
1 mark
1 but
1 yet
1 a
1 little
1 moment
1 would
1 settle
1 his
1 hopes
1 and
1 fears
1 1
1 1
1 Every
1 breath
1 was
1 hushed
1 and
1 every
1 heart
1 in
1 that
1 old
1 ship
1 beat
1 painfully
1 The
1 boat
1 was
1 yet
1 some
1 distance
1 from
1 the
1 boys
1 while
1 the
1 horrid
1 sea
1 -monster
1 was
1 fearfully
1 near
1 Suddenly
1 the
1 air
1 was
1 rent
1 by
1 the
1 roar
1 of
1 the
1 heavy
1 gun
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 old
1 man
1 knew
1 his
1 shot
1 was
1 gone
1 he
1 sank
1 back
1 upon
1 the
1 hatch
1 and
1 covered
1 his
1 face
1 with
1 his
1 hands
1 as
1 if
1 afraid
1 to
1 see
1 the
1 result
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 efforts
1 for
1 if
1 he
1 had
1 failed
1 he
1 knew
1 that
1 his
1 boy
1 was
1 lost
1 1
1 2
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 after
1 the
1 report
1 of
1 the
1 gun
1 had
1 died
1 away
1 upon
1 the
1 air
1 there
1 was
1 an
1 unbroken
1 silence
1 but
1 as
1 the
1 dense
1 smoke
1 arose
1 from
1 the
1 surface
1 of
1 the
1 water
1 there
1 was
1 at
1 first
1 a
1 low
1 murmur
1 breaking
1 from
1 the
1 lips
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 -
1 -that
1 murmur
1 grew
1 louder
1 and
1 stronger
1 till
1 it
1 swelled
1 to
1 a
1 joyous
1 deafening
1 shout
1 The
1 old
1 gunner
1 sprang
1 to
1 his
1 feet
1 and
1 gazed
1 off
1 on
1 the
1 water
1 and
1 the
1 first
1 thing
1 that
1 met
1 his
1 view
1 was
1 the
1 huge
1 carcass
1 of
1 the
1 shark
1 floating
1 on

1 back

1 In

1 reached
1 the
1 daring
1 swimmers
1 and
1 greatly
1 frightened
1 they
1 were
1 brought
1 on

1 The
1 old
1 man
1 clasped
1 his
1 boy
1 in
1 his
1 arms
1 and
1 then
1 overcome
1 by
1 the
1 powerful
1 excitement
1 he
1 leaned
1 upon

1 A
1 certain
1 Persian
1 king
1 while
1 traveling
1 in
1 disguise
1 with
1 but
1 few
1 attendants
1 was
1 waylaid
1 by
1 robbers
1 who
1 threatened
1 to
1 take
1 not
1 only
1 his
1 goods
1 but
1 his
1 life
1 2
1 Feeling
1 himself
1 beyond
1 the
1 reach
1 of
1 human
1 aid
1 he
1 inwardly
1 made
1 a
1 vow
1 that
1 if
1 God
1 would
1 incline
1 the
1 hearts
1 of
1 these
1 ruffians
1 to
1 mercy
1 and
1 restore
1 him
1 in
1 safety
1 to
1 his
1 family
1 and
1 people
1 he
1 would
1 distribute
1 all
1 the
1 money
1 then
1 in
1 his
1 treasury
1 in
1 alms
1 to
1 the
1 needy
1 of
1 his
1 realm
1 3
1 The
1 robbers
1 from
1 some
1 unknown
1 cause
1 liberated
1 him
1 and
1 he
1 soon
1 reached
1 home
1 in
1 safety
1 having
1 sustained
1 no
1 injury
1 save
1 the
1 loss
1 of
1 the
1 small
1 purse
1 of
1 gold
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 carried
1 in
1 his
1 girdle
1 4
1 Desirous
1 of
1 keeping
1 the
1 vow
1 he
1 had
1 made
1 he
1 summoned
1 his
1 officers
1 and
1 commanded
1 them
1 to
1 make
1 immediate
1 distribution
1 to
1 the
1 poor
1 of
1 all
1 that
1 the
1 treasury
1 contained
1 at
1 the
1 time
1 of
1 his
1 return
1 5
1 But
1 his
1 officers
1 more
1 miserly
1 than
1 himself
1 and
1 fearful
1 that
1 they
1 might
1 fall
1 short
1 in
1 their
1 salaries
1 and
1 pensions
1 began
1 to
1 urge
1 upon
1 the
1 monarch
1 the
1 folly
1 of
1 keeping
1 this
1 rash
1 vow
1 and
1 the
1 danger
1 of
1 thus
1 involving
1 himself
1 and
1 his
1 kingdom
1 in
1 difficulties
1 6
1 Finding
1 he
1 still
1 remained
1 firm
1 they
1 took
1 other
1 grounds
1 and
1 plausibly
1 argued
1 that
1 the
1 troops
1 and
1 other
1 officials
1 needed
1 aid
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 the
1 poor
1 and
1 as
1 by
1 the
1 words
1 of
1 his
1 vow
1 he
1 had
1 bound
1 himself
1 to
1 distribute
1 the
1 contents
1 of
1 the
1 treasury
1 to
1 those
1 who
1 had
1 claim
1 to
1 relief
1 the
1 public
1 servants
1 certainly
1 came
1 within
1 the
1 required
1 limits
1 7
1 Bewildered
1 by
1 their
1 false
1 logic
1 and
1 sincerely
1 desirous
1 of
1 doing
1 right
1 he
1 appealed
1 to
1 a
1 certain
1 sage
1 who
1 dwelt
1 near
1 the
1 royal
1 palace
1 and
1 determined
1 to
1 abide
1 by
1 his
1 decision
1 8
1 The
1 sage
1 after
1 hearing
1 the
1 case
1 only
1 asked
1 the
1 following
1 simple
1 question
1 Of
1 whom
1 were
1 you
1 thinking
1 when
1 you
1 made
1 the
1 vow
1 -
1 -the
1 poor
1 or
1 the
1 public
1 servants
1 The
1 monarch
1 replied
1 Of
1 the
1 poor
1 Then
1 answered
1 the
1 sage
1 it
1 is
1 to
1 the
1 poor
1 you
1 are
1 bound
1 to
1 distribute
1 these
1 funds
1 for
1 you
1 are
1 not
1 really
1 fulfilling
1 your
1 vow
1 unless
1 you
1 do
1 that
1 which
1 you
1 intended
1 to
1 do
1 when
1 it
1 was
1 made
1 The
1 king
1 was
1 satisfied
1 that
1 this
1 was
1 the
1 right
1 decision
1 and
1 did
1 as
1 the
1 sage
1 advised
1 9
1 Let
1 the
1 young
1 bear
1 in

1 that
1 God
1 is
1 a
1 being
1 of
1 truth
1 requiring
1 truth
1 in
1 the
1 inward
1 heart
1 and
1 if
1 they
1 would
1 have
1 His
1 approval
1 and
1 that
1 of
1 their
1 own
1 consciences
1 they
1 must
1 avoid
1 not
1 only
1 the
1 outward
1 appearance
1 of
1 falsehood
1 but
1 the
1 slightest
1 evasion
1 or
1 deceit
1 and
1 when

1 made
1 fulfill

1 1
1 hang
1 the

1 was
1 naturally
1 avaricious
1 nobody
1 loved

1 better

1 he
1 or

1 But
1 if
1 a

1 he

1 of

1 he
1 might

1 and

1 3
1 hang
1 however
1 with
1 all
1 his
1 eagerness
1 for
1 riches
1 was
1 poor
1 He
1 had
1 nothing
1 but
1 the
1 profits
1 of
1 his
1 mill
1 to
1 support
1 him
1 but
1 though
1 these
1 were
1 small
1 they
1 were
1 certain
1 while
1 it
1 stood
1 and
1 went
1 he
1 was
1 sure
1 of
1 eating
1 and
1 his
1 frugality
1 was
1 such
1 that
1 he
1 every
1 day
1 laid
1 some
1 money
1 by
1 which
1 he
1 would
1 at
1 intervals
1 count
1 and
1 contemplate
1 with
1 much
1 satisfaction
1 4
1 Yet
1 still
1 his
1 acquisitions
1 were
1 not
1 equal
1 to
1 his
1 desires
1 he
1 only
1 found
1 himself
1 above
1 want
1 whereas
1 he
1 desired
1 to
1 be
1 possessed
1 of
1 affluence
1 One
1 day
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 indulging
1 these
1 wishes
1 he
1 was
1 informed
1 that
1 a
1 neighbor
1 of
1 his
1 had
1 found
1 a
1 pan
1 of
1 money
1 under
1 ground
1 having
1 dreamed
1 of
1 it
1 three
1 nights
1 in
1 succession
1 5
1 These
1 tidings
1 were
1 daggers
1 to
1 the
1 heart
1 of
1 poor
1 hang
1 Here
1 am
1 I
1 said
1 he
1 toiling
1 and
1 moiling
1 from
1 morning
1 till
1 night
1 for
1 a
1 few
1 paltry
1 farthings
1 while
1 neighbor
1 Thanks
1 only
1 goes
1 quietly
1 to
1 bed
1 and
1 dreams
1 himself
1 into
1 thousands
1 before
1 morning
1 Oh
1 that
1 I
1 could
1 dream
1 like
1 him
1 ith
1 what
1 pleasure
1 would
1 I
1 dig
1 round
1 the
1 pan
1 How
1 slyly
1 would
1 I
1 carry
1 it
1 home
1 Not
1 even
1 my
1 wife
1 should
1 see
1 me
1 And
1 then
1 oh
1 the
1 pleasure
1 of
1 thrusting
1 one
1 s
1 hands
1 into
1 a
1 heap
1 of
1 gold
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 elbows
1 6
1 Such
1 reflections
1 only
1 served
1 to
1 make
1 the
1 miller
1 unhappy
1 He
1 discontinued
1 his
1 former
1 assiduity
1 he
1 was
1 quite
1 disgusted
1 with
1 small
1 gains
1 and
1 his
1 customers
1 began
1 to
1 forsake
1 him
1 Every
1 day
1 he
1 repeated
1 the
1 wish
1 and
1 every
1 night
1 laid
1 himself
1 down
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 dream
1 Fortune
1 that
1 was
1 for
1 a
1 long
1 time
1 unkind
1 at
1 last
1 however
1 seemed
1 to
1 smile
1 upon
1 his
1 distress
1 and
1 indulged
1 him
1 with
1 the
1 wished
1 -for
1 vision
1 7
1 He
1 dreamed
1 that
1 under
1 a
1 certain
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 foundation
1 of
1 his
1 mill
1 there
1 was
1 concealed
1 a
1 monstrous
1 pan
1 of
1 gold
1 and
1 diamonds
1 buried
1 deep
1 in
1 the
1 ground
1 and
1 covered
1 with
1 a
1 large
1 flat
1 stone
1 He
1 concealed
1 his
1 good
1 luck
1 from
1 every
1 person
1 as
1 is
1 usual
1 in
1 money
1 -dreams
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 have
1 the
1 vision
1 repeated
1 the
1 two
1 succeeding
1 nights
1 by
1 which
1 he
1 should
1 be
1 certain
1 of
1 its
1 truth
1 His
1 wishes
1 in
1 this
1 also
1 were
1 answered
1 he
1 still
1 dreamed
1 of
1 the
1 same
1 pan
1 of
1 money
1 in
1 the
1 very
1 same
1 place
1 8
1 Now
1 therefore
1 it
1 was
1 past
1 a
1 doubt
1 so
1 getting
1 up
1 early
1 the
1 third
1 morning
1 he
1 repaired
1 alone
1 with
1 a
1 mattock
1 in
1 his
1 hand
1 to
1 the
1 mill
1 and
1 began
1 to
1 undermine
1 that
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 wall
1 to
1 which
1 the
1 vision
1 directed
1 The
1 first
1 omen
1 of
1 success
1 that
1 he
1 met
1 with
1 was
1 a
1 broken
1 ring
1 digging
1 still
1 deeper
1 he
1 turned
1 up
1 a
1 house
1 -tile
1 quite
1 new
1 and
1 entire
1 9
1 At
1 last
1 after
1 much
1 digging
1 he
1 came
1 to
1 a
1 broad
1 flat
1 stone
1 but
1 then
1 it
1 was
1 so
1 large
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 beyond
1 his
1 strength
1 to
1 remove
1 it
1 There
1 cried
1 he
1 in
1 raptures
1 to
1 himself
1 there
1 it
1 is
1 under
1 this
1 stone
1 there
1 is
1 room
1 for
1 a
1 very
1 large
1 pan
1 of
1 diamonds
1 indeed
1 I
1 must
1 e
1 en
1 go
1 home
1 to
1 my
1 wife
1 and
1 tell
1 her
1 the
1 whole
1 affair
1 and
1 get
1 her
1 to
1 assist
1 me
1 in
1 turning
1 it
1 up
1 Away
1 therefore
1 he
1 goes
1 and
1 acquaints
1 his
1 wife
1 with
1 every
1 circumstance
1 of
1 their
1 good
1 fortune
1 1
1 0
1 Her
1 raptures
1 on

1 occasion
1 may
1 easily
1 be

1 she
1 flew
1 round
1 his
1 neck
1 and
1 embraced
1 him
1 in
1 an
1 agony
1 of
1 joy
1 But
1 these
1 transports
1 however
1 did
1 not
1 allay
1 their
1 eagerness
1 to

1 sum

1 together
1 to
1 the
1 place
1 where

1 in

1 with
1 the

1 that

1 Born
1 in

1 when

1 that

1 then
1 it

1 finds
1 that

1 at

1 time

1 eleven
1 days
1 off

1 2
1 Forward
1 the
1 vessel
1 was
1 thickly
1 coated
1 with
1 ice
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 hard
1 work
1 to
1 handle
1 her
1 as
1 the
1 rigging
1 and
1 sails
1 were
1 stiff
1 and
1 yielded
1 only

1 cold
1 night
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 I
1 said
1 to
1 my
1 mate
1 as
1 I
1 tarried
1 for
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 upon
1 deck
1 The
1 worthy
1 down
1 -easter
1 buttoned
1 his
1 coat
1 more
1 tightly
1 around
1 him
1 and
1 looking
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 moon
1 replied
1 It
1 s
1 a

1 captain
1 and
1 nothing
1 can
1 live
1 comfortably
1 out

1 The

1 is

1 and
1 it

1 to

1 a

1 look
1 -out
1 for

1 Mr

1 said
1 I
1 as

1 turned
1 to

1 below
1 Ay
1 ay

1 responded
1 the
1 faithful
1 mate
1 5
1 About
1 two
1 hours
1 afterward
1 I
1 was
1 aroused
1 from

1 by
1 the

1 officer
1 Excuse
1 me
1 for

1 you
1 captain
1 said
1 he
1 as
1 he
1 detected
1 an
1 expression
1 of
1 vexation
1 in
1 my
1 face
1 but
1 I
1 wish
1 you
1 would
1 turn
1 out
1 and

1 on

1 as

1 6
1 hat
1 s
1 the
1 matter
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 said
1 I
1 hy
1 sir
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 watching
1 a
1 large
1 cake
1 of
1 ice
1 which
1 swept
1 by
1 at
1 a
1 distance
1 a
1 moment
1 ago
1 and
1 I
1 saw
1 something
1 black
1 upon
1 it
1 something
1 that
1 I
1 thought
1 moved
1 The
1 moon
1 is
1 under
1 a
1 cloud
1 and
1 I
1 could
1 not
1 see
1 distinctly
1 but
1 I
1 believe
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 child
1 floating
1 out
1 to
1 the
1 sea
1 this
1 freezing
1 night
1 on
1 that
1 cake
1 of
1 ice
1 7
1 e
1 were
1 on
1 deck
1 before
1 either
1 spoke
1 another
1 word
1 The
1 mate
1 pointed
1 out
1 with
1 no
1 little
1 difficulty
1 the
1 cake
1 of
1 ice
1 floating
1 off
1 to
1 the
1 leeward
1 with
1 its
1 white
1 glittering
1 surface
1 broken
1 by
1 a
1 black
1 spot
1 Get
1 the
1 glass
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 said
1 I
1 the
1 moon
1 will
1 be
1 out
1 of
1 that
1 cloud
1 in
1 a
1 moment
1 and
1 then
1 we
1 can
1 see
1 distinctly
1 8
1 I
1 kept
1 my
1 eye
1 upon
1 the
1 receding
1 mass
1 of
1 ice
1 while
1 the
1 moon
1 was
1 slowly
1 working
1 her
1 way
1 through
1 a
1 heavy
1 bank
1 of
1 clouds
1 The
1 mate
1 stood
1 by
1 me
1 with
1 the
1 glass
1 and
1 when
1 the
1 full
1 light
1 fell
1 upon
1 the
1 water
1 with
1 a
1 brilliancy
1 only
1 known
1 in
1 our
1 northern
1 latitudes
1 I
1 put
1 the
1 glass
1 to
1 my
1 eye
1 One
1 glance
1 was
1 enough
1 9
1 Forward
1 there
1 I
1 hailed
1 at
1 the
1 top
1 of
1 my
1 voice
1 and
1 with
1 one
1 bound
1 I
1 reached
1 the
1 main
1 hatch
1 and
1 began
1 to
1 clear
1 away
1 the
1 little
1 cutter
1 which
1 was
1 stowed
1 in
1 the
1 ship
1 s
1 yawl
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 had
1 taken
1 the
1 glass
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 himself
1 There
1 are
1 two
1 children
1 on
1 that
1 cake
1 of
1 ice
1 he
1 exclaimed
1 as
1 he
1 hastened
1 to
1 assist
1 me
1 in
1 getting
1 out
1 the
1 boat
1 1
1 0
1 The
1 men
1 answered
1 my
1 hail
1 and
1 walked
1 quickly
1 aft
1 In
1 a
1 short
1 space
1 of
1 time
1 we
1 launched
1 the
1 cutter
1 into
1 which
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 and
1 myself
1 jumped
1 followed
1 by
1 the
1 two
1 men
1 who
1 took
1 the
1 oars
1 I
1 rigged
1 the
1 tiller
1 and
1 the
1 mate
1 sat
1 beside
1 me
1 in
1 the
1 stern
1 sheets
1 1
1 1
1 Do
1 you
1 see
1 that
1 cake
1 of
1 ice
1 with
1 something
1 black
1 upon
1 it
1 my
1 lads
1 Put
1 me
1 alongside
1 of
1 that
1 and
1 I
1 ll
1 give
1 you
1 a
1 month
1 s

1 wages
1 when
1 you
1 are
1 paid
1 off
1 said
1 I
1 to
1 the
1 men
1 1
1 2
1 They
1 bent
1 to
1 their
1 oars
1 but
1 their
1 strokes
1 were
1 uneven
1 and
1 feeble
1 for
1 they
1 were
1 worn
1 out
1 by
1 the
1 hard
1 duty
1 of
1 the
1 preceding
1 fortnight
1 and
1 though
1 they
1 did
1 their
1 best
1 the
1 boat
1 made
1 little
1 more
1 headway
1 than
1 the
1 tide
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 losing
1 chase
1 and
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 who
1 was
1 suffering
1 torture
1 as
1 he
1 saw
1 how
1 little
1 we
1 gained
1 cried
1 out

1 for
1 life
1 1
1 3
1 A
1 convulsive
1 effort
1 at
1 the
1 oars
1 told
1 how
1 willing
1 the
1 men
1 were
1 to
1 obey
1 but
1 the
1 strength
1 of
1 the
1 strong
1 man
1 was
1 gone
1 One
1 of
1 the
1 poor
1 fellows
1 washed
1 us
1 twice
1 in
1 recovering
1 his
1 oar
1 and
1 then
1 gave
1 out
1 and
1 the
1 other
1 was
1 nearly
1 as
1 far
1 gone
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 sprang
1 forward
1 and
1 seized
1 the
1 deserted
1 oar
1 Lie
1 down
1 in
1 the
1 bottom
1 of
1 the
1 boat
1 said
1 he
1 to
1 the

1 and

1 take
1 the
1 other
1 oar
1 we
1 must
1 row
1 for
1 ourselves
1 1

1 I
1 took
1 the
1 second
1 man
1 s
1 place
1 Larkin
1 had
1 stripped
1 off
1 his
1 coat
1 and
1 as
1 he
1 pulled
1 the
1 bow
1 I
1 waited
1 for
1 the
1 signal
1 stroke
1 It
1 came
1 gently
1 but
1 firm
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 moment
1 we
1 were
1 pulling
1 a
1 long
1 steady
1 stroke
1 gradually
1 increasing
1 in
1 rapidity
1 until
1 the
1 wood
1 seemed
1 to
1 smoke
1 in
1 the
1 row
1 -locks
1 e
1 kept
1 time
1 each
1 by
1 the
1 long
1 deep
1 breathing
1 of
1 the
1 other
1 1
1 5
1 Such
1 a
1 pull
1 e
1 bent
1 forward
1 until
1 our
1 faces
1 almost
1 touched
1 our
1 knees
1 and
1 then
1 throwing
1 all
1 our
1 strength
1 into
1 the
1 backward
1 movement
1 drew
1 on
1 the
1 oar
1 until
1 every
1 inch
1 covered
1 by
1 the
1 sweep
1 was
1 gained
1 Thus
1 we
1 worked
1 at
1 the
1 oars
1 for
1 fifteen
1 minutes
1 and
1 it
1 seemed
1 to
1 me
1 as
1 many
1 hours
1 The
1 sweat
1 rolled
1 off
1 in
1 great
1 drops
1 and
1 I
1 was
1 enveloped
1 in
1 a
1 steam
1 generated
1 from
1 my
1 own
1 body
1 1
1 6
1 Are
1 we
1 almost
1 up
1 to
1 it
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 I
1 gasped
1 out
1 Almost
1 captain
1 said
1 he
1 and
1 don

1 dear
1 little
1 ones

1 The
1 oars
1 flashed
1 as
1 their
1 blades
1 turned
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 moonlight
1 for
1 the
1 men
1 who
1 plied
1 them
1 were

1 and
1 had
1 fathers

1 1
1 7
1 Suddenly
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 ceased
1 pulling
1 and
1 my
1 heart
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 almost
1 stopped
1 its
1 beating
1 for
1 the
1 terrible
1 thought
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 given
1 out
1 crossed
1 my
1 mind
1 But
1 I
1 was
1 re
1 -assured
1 by
1 his
1 voice
1 p
1 Gently
1 captain
1 gently
1 a
1 stroke
1 or
1 two
1 more
1 there
1 that
1 will
1 do
1 and
1 the
1 next
1 moment
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 sprang
1 upon
1 the
1 ice
1 I
1 started
1 up
1 and
1 calling
1 to
1 the
1 men
1 to
1 make
1 fast
1 the
1 boat
1 to
1 the

1 followed
1 him
1 1
1 8
1 e
1 ran
1 to
1 the
1 dark
1 spot
1 in
1 the
1 center
1 of
1 the
1 mass
1 and
1 found
1 two
1 little
1 boys
1 The
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 smaller
1 was
1 resting
1 in
1 the
1 bosom
1 of
1 the
1 larger
1 and
1 both
1 were
1 fast
1 asleep
1 The
1 lethargy
1 which
1 would
1 have
1 been
1 fatal
1 but
1 for
1 the
1 timely
1 rescue
1 had
1 overcome
1 them
1 1
1 9
1 Mr
1 Larkin
1 grasped
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 lads
1 cut
1 off
1 his
1 shoes
1 tore
1 off
1 his
1 jacket
1 and
1 then
1 loosening
1 his
1 own
1 garments
1 to
1 the
1 skin
1 placed
1 the
1 cold
1 child
1 in
1 contact
1 with
1 his
1 own
1 warm
1 body
1 carefully
1 wrapping
1 his
1 overcoat
1 around
1 him
1 I
1 did
1 the
1 same
1 with
1 the

1 about
1 ten
1 miles
1 above
1 New

1 A
1 movement
1 of
1 the

1 set
1 the

1 in

1 and
1 the
1 little

1 that

1 call
1 you
1 the

1 Caroline
1 That
1 would
1 be
1 mere

1 Horace
1 and
1 would
1 make

1 ridiculous
1 Horace
1 Nothing
1 can
1 be
1 more
1 inconsistent
1 in

1 than
1 aiming
1 at
1 titles
1 Caroline
1 For
1 us
1 I
1 grant
1 you
1 but
1 if
1 they
1 were
1 hereditary
1 if
1 we
1 had
1 been

1 if
1 they

1 then
1 we
1 might
1 be

1 I
1 never

1 to

1 that

1 should

1 be

1 under

1 by
1 some
1 titled
1 personage
1 whom
1 in
1 your

1 you
1 despised
1 what
1 then
1 Caroline
1 You
1 may
1 easily
1 suppose
1 that

1 did

1 No
1 I
1 meant

1 be

1 Horace
1 Your

1 tell

1 that

1 not
1 be

1 among

1 for

1 Now
1 Caroline
1 is
1 it
1 not
1 better
1 to
1 be
1 born
1 under

1 where
1 there
1 are
1 no
1 such
1 ranks
1 and
1 where
1 the

1 is

1 Talent

1 2
1 These

1 the

1 were

1 For

1 and

1 increased
1 the

1 was

1 To

1 the

1 the

1 passed
1 a
1 law
1 for
1 establishing
1 a
1 coinage
1 of

1 and

1 Captain

1 Hull
1 was
1 appointed
1 to
1 manufacture
1 this
1 money
1 and
1 was
1 to
1 have
1 one
1 shilling
1 out
1 of
1 every
1 twenty
1 to
1 pay
1 him
1 for
1 the
1 trouble
1 of
1 making
1 them
1 5
1 Hereupon
1 all
1 the
1 old
1 silver
1 in
1 the
1 colony
1 was
1 handed
1 over
1 to
1 Captain

1 The
1 battered

1 such
1 curious
1 old
1 articles
1 were
1 doubtless
1 thrown
1 into
1 the
1 melting
1 -pot
1 together
1 But
1 by
1 far
1 the
1 greater
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 silver
1 consisted
1 of
1 bullion
1 from
1 the
1 mines
1 of
1 South
1 America
1 which
1 the
1 English
1 buccaneers
1 who
1 were

1 than

1 had
1 taken
1 from
1 the
1 Spaniards
1 and
1 brought
1 to

1 6
1 All
1 this
1 old
1 and
1 new
1 silver
1 being
1 melted
1 down
1 and

1 the
1 result
1 was
1 an
1 immense
1 amount

1 they
1 were

1 shillings
1 that
1 he
1 coined
1 you
1 will
1 remember
1 Captain
1 John
1 Hull
1 was
1 entitled
1 to
1 put
1 one
1 shilling
1 into
1 his
1 own
1 pocket
1 7
1 The
1 magistrates
1 soon
1 began
1 to
1 suspect
1 that
1 the
1 mint
1 -master
1 would
1 have
1 the
1 best
1 of
1 the
1 bargain
1 They
1 offered
1 him
1 a
1 large
1 sum
1 of
1 money
1 if
1 he
1 would
1 but
1 give
1 up
1 that
1 twentieth
1 shilling
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 continually
1 dropping
1 into
1 his
1 own
1 pocket
1 But
1 Captain
1 Hull
1 declared
1 himself
1 perfectly
1 satisfied
1 with
1 the
1 shilling
1 And
1 well
1 he
1 might
1 be
1 for
1 so
1 diligently
1 did
1 he
1 labor
1 that
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 years
1 his
1 pockets

1 money
1 -bags
1 and
1 his
1 strong
1 box
1 were
1 overflowing
1 with
1 pine
1 -tree
1 shillings
1 This
1 was
1 probably
1 the
1 case
1 when
1 he
1 came
1 into

1 of
1 Grandfather

1 chair
1 and
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 worked
1 so
1 hard
1 at
1 the
1 mint
1 it
1 was
1 certainly
1 proper
1 that

1 should
1 have
1 a
1 comfortable
1 chair
1 to
1 rest
1 himself
1 in

1 very

1 gave
1 his
1 consent

1 Yes
1 you

1 take
1 her
1 said
1 he
1 in

1 and

1 ll
1 find
1 her
1 a

1 burden
1 enough
1 On
1 the
1 wedding
1 -day
1 we
1 may
1 suppose
1 that

1 John
1 Hull
1 dressed

1 in
1 a
1 plum
1 -colored
1 coat
1 all

1 were

1 Thus
1 attired
1 he
1 sat
1 with
1 great

1 in
1 Grandfather

1 and
1 being
1 a

1 old

1 he
1 completely

1 On

1 him
1 to
1 put
1 on
1 His
1 hair

1 had
1 forbidden

1 1
1 I
1 had
1 left
1 the
1 hunting
1 party
1 more
1 than
1 an
1 hour
1 when
1 I
1 came
1 upon
1 the
1 track
1 of
1 my
1 old
1 friend
1 Konwell
1 who
1 was
1 with
1 his
1 dogs
1 on
1 the
1 bloody
1 trail
1 of
1 a
1 panther
1 The
1 animal
1 must

1 had
1 one
1 of

1 legs
1 broken
1 this
1 was
1 indicated
1 by
1 the
1 marks
1 on
1 the
1 soft
1 ground
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 plain
1 that
1 the
1 tracks
1 were
1 made
1 by
1 three
1 feet
1 instead
1 of
1 four
1 and
1 accompanied
1 by

1 at
1 every

1 I
1 determined
1 to
1 follow
1 and
1 after
1 a
1 tramp
1 of
1 nearly
1 an
1 hour
1 I
1 overtook
1 my
1 friend
1 at
1 the
1 entrance
1 of
1 a
1 cavern
1 where
1 he
1 stood
1 waiting
1 for
1 me
1 The
1 wounded
1 animal
1 had
1 taken
1 refuge
1 in
1 this
1 cave
1 leaving
1 us
1 to
1 do
1 whatever
1 we
1 thought
1 best
1 The
1 poor
1 beast
1 doubtless
1 supposed
1 that
1 within
1 this
1 murky
1 recess
1 he
1 was
1 safe
1 from
1 pursuit
1 but
1 he
1 was
1 mistaken
1 Konwell
1 informed
1 me
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 hidden
1 a
1 bundle
1 of
1 pine
1 splinters
1 in
1 a
1 gulley
1 about
1 half
1 a
1 mile
1 distant
1 and
1 that
1 if
1 I
1 would
1 keep
1 guard
1 over
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 cave
1 he
1 would
1 go
1 and
1 bring
1 it
1 3
1 I
1 agreed
1 to
1 this
1 measure
1 and
1 with
1 ready
1 gun
1 and
1 drawn
1 knife
1 prepared
1 for
1 any
1 attack
1 that
1 might
1 be
1 made
1 I
1 lay
1 down
1 at
1 the
1 entrance
1 of
1 the
1 panther
1 s
1 cave
1 My
1 friend
1 soon
1 returned
1 bringing
1 the
1 pine
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 promised
1 His
1 next
1 movement
1 was
1 to
1 kindle
1 a
1 large
1 fire
1 at
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 cave
1 at
1 which
1 we
1 lighted
1 our
1 torches
1 and
1 having
1 taken
1 the
1 flambeaus
1 in
1 our
1 left
1 hand
1 while
1 we
1 carried
1 our
1 guns
1 in
1 the
1 right
1 we
1 cautiously
1 entered
1 the
1 cave
1 I
1 crept
1 on
1 before
1 but
1 the
1 space
1 within
1 soon
1 became
1 so
1 high
1 and
1 roomy
1 that
1 we
1 could
1 stand
1 upright
1 and
1 keep
1 close
1 to
1 each

1 4
1 Bending
1 toward
1 the
1 left
1 the
1 cavity
1 extended
1 a
1 considerable
1 distance
1 within
1 the
1 hill
1 After
1 we
1 had
1 advanced
1 about
1 two
1 hundred
1 steps
1 we
1 saw
1 the
1 glaring
1 eyes
1 of
1 the
1 wounded
1 beast
1 which
1 gleamed
1 forth
1 like
1 two
1 fiery
1 balls
1 reflecting
1 most
1 luridly
1 the
1 light
1 of
1 our
1 torches
1 Konwell
1 now
1 took
1 my
1 flambeau
1 and
1 stepped
1 behind
1 me
1 I
1 leveled
1 my
1 gun
1 in
1 the
1 direction
1 of
1 those
1 flaming
1 eyes
1 and
1 fired
1 After
1 the
1 report
1 we
1 heard
1 a
1 bustle
1 but
1 could
1 not
1 exactly
1 make
1 out
1 what
1 it
1 meant
1 5
1 I
1 reloaded
1 my
1 gun
1 resumed
1 my

1 and
1 Konwell
1 now
1 took

1 front
1 But
1 as
1 those
1 flaming
1 eyes
1 were
1 no
1 longer
1 to
1 be
1 seen
1 we
1 felt
1 obliged
1 to
1 go
1 farther
1 Our
1 guns
1 ready
1 loaded
1 we
1 believed
1 ourselves
1 to
1 be
1 prepared
1 for
1 anything
1 e
1 proceeded
1 carefully
1 as
1 men
1 are
1 likely
1 to
1 do
1 when
1 suspecting
1 danger
1 when
1 instantly
1 the
1 panther
1 started
1 up
1 from
1 a
1 hollow
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 lying
1 quite
1 close
1 to
1 our
1 feet
1 6
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 fearful
1 sight
1 to
1 look
1 upon
1 him
1 as
1 he
1 stood
1 with
1 ears
1 laid
1 back
1 his
1 white
1 teeth
1 set
1 together
1 as
1 if
1 in
1 intense
1 anger
1 and
1 those
1 wide
1 open
1 eyes
1 glowing
1 and
1 sparkling
1 as
1 they
1 rested
1 upon
1 us
1 his
1 assailants
1 I
1 can
1 never
1 forget
1 his
1 appearance
1 In
1 a
1 moment
1 our
1 guns
1 were
1 discharged
1 and
1 the
1 cave
1 returned
1 the
1 thundering
1 echo
1 e
1 had
1 both
1 fired
1 so
1 precisely
1 at
1 the
1 same
1 moment
1 that
1 neither
1 of
1 us
1 could
1 believe
1 the
1 other
1 had
1 discharged
1 his
1 gun
1 7
1 e
1 were
1 certain
1 that
1 our
1 enemy
1 had
1 been
1 struck
1 but
1 we
1 knew
1 not
1 whether
1 killed
1 or
1 only
1 disabled
1 Quick
1 as
1 thought
1 we
1 dropped
1 our
1 guns
1 and
1 drew
1 our
1 knives
1 from
1 the
1 sheath
1 And
1 haste
1 was
1 necessary
1 for
1 the
1 echo
1 had
1 not
1 relapsed
1 into
1 silence
1 before
1 we
1 felt
1 the
1 weight
1 of
1 the
1 panther
1 against
1 us
1 and
1 we
1 began
1 cutting
1 at
1 him
1 with
1 our
1 knives
1 and
1 at
1 the
1 same
1 moment
1 in
1 consequence
1 of
1 our
1 hurried
1 movements
1 our
1 torches
1 died
1 out
1 and
1 we
1 were
1 left
1 in
1 utter
1 darkness
1 8
1 Deafened
1 by
1 the
1 noise
1 and
1 utterly
1 bewildered
1 I
1 turned
1 to
1 fly
1 from
1 the
1 now
1 raging
1 enemy
1 and
1 only
1 became
1 perfectly
1 aware
1 of
1 what
1 I
1 was
1 doing
1 when
1 I
1 found
1 myself
1 standing
1 beside
1 Konwell
1 outside
1 the
1 cave
1 in
1 the
1 open
1 air
1 I
1 only
1 know
1 now
1 that
1 enveloped
1 in
1 thick
1 darkness
1 and
1 almost
1 suffocated
1 with
1 the
1 smoke
1 of
1 gunpowder
1 I
1 groped
1 about
1 not
1 knowing
1 what
1 I
1 wished
1 or
1 intended
1 and
1 that
1 Konwell
1 at
1 last
1 drew
1 me
1 forcibly
1 to
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 cave
1 9
1 There
1 we
1 stood
1 each
1 one
1 brandishing
1 his
1 hunting
1 -knife
1 in
1 his
1 right
1 hand
1 and
1 holding
1 the
1 extinguished
1 torch
1 in
1 the
1 left
1 as
1 we
1 looked
1 on
1 each
1 other
1 we
1 scarcely
1 knew
1 whether
1 to
1 laugh
1 or
1 to
1 be
1 frightened
1 at
1 the
1 strange
1 figures
1 we
1 made
1 e
1 were
1 black
1 with
1 powder
1 -smoke
1 covered
1 with
1 sweat
1 and
1 blood
1 and
1 our
1 clothing
1 torn
1 to
1 rags
1 1
1 0
1 Konwell
1 complained
1 of
1 a
1 pain
1 in
1 his
1 breast
1 I
1 opened
1 the
1 bosom
1 of
1 his
1 shirt
1 and
1 found
1 two
1 deep
1 gashes
1 made
1 by
1 the
1 panther
1 s
1 claws
1 extending
1 from
1 the
1 left
1 shoulder
1 to
1 the
1 pit
1 of
1 the
1 stomach
1 I
1 also
1 received
1 a
1 few
1 scratches
1 but
1 our
1 stout
1 hunting
1 -shirts
1 were
1 torn
1 to
1 shreds
1 1
1 1
1 Until
1 this
1 moment
1 neither
1 of
1 us
1 had
1 felt
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 wounded
1 and
1 even
1 now
1 before
1 we
1 began
1 to
1 think
1 of
1 dressing
1 those
1 wounds
1 we
1 made
1 a
1 large
1 fire
1 at
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 cavern
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 prevent
1 the
1 panther
1 from
1 coming
1 forth
1 This
1 done
1 we
1 sat
1 down
1 beside
1 the
1 genial
1 blaze
1 to
1 wash
1 and
1 bind
1 up
1 our
1 scratches
1 and
1 consult
1 on
1 what
1 plan
1 it
1 was
1 now
1 best
1 to
1 proceed
1 1
1 2
1 That
1 the
1 panther
1 was
1 still
1 in
1 the
1 cave
1 we
1 were
1 certain
1 but
1 whether
1 living
1 or
1 dead
1 we
1 did
1 not
1 know
1 at
1 all
1 events
1 he
1 was
1 wounded
1 for
1 our
1 hunting
1 -knives
1 were
1 covered
1 with
1 blood
1 quite
1 up
1 to
1 the
1 hilt
1 But
1 we
1 had
1 no
1 choice
1 left
1 we
1 must
1 return
1 for
1 our
1 guns
1 and
1 Konwell
1 s
1 powder
1 -flask
1 which
1 the
1 animal
1 dragged
1 off
1 with
1 him
1 still
1 lay
1 within
1 the
1 cavern
1 e
1 therefore
1 plucked
1 up
1 new
1 courage
1 and
1 having
1 relighted
1 our
1 torches
1 we
1 brandished
1 our
1 knives
1 and
1 prepared
1 though
1 not
1 without
1 some
1 heart
1 throbbings
1 once
1 more
1 to
1 enter
1 the
1 panther
1 s
1 den
1 1
1 3
1 ith
1 light
1 and
1 cautious
1 steps
1 lest
1 we
1 might
1 be
1 as
1 unpleasantly
1 surprised
1 as
1 we
1 had
1 been
1 when
1 we
1 made
1 our
1 hasty
1 retreat
1 we
1 advanced
1 holding
1 our
1 torches
1 before
1 us
1 to
1 the
1 spot
1 where
1 we
1 had
1 dropped
1 our
1 guns
1 and
1 without
1 meeting
1 with
1 any
1 hinderance
1 from
1 our
1 enemy
1 Once
1 more
1 in
1 possession
1 of
1 our
1 trusty
1 weapons
1 we
1 reloaded
1 them
1 and
1 stepped
1 forward
1 with
1 lighter
1 hearts
1 yet
1 still
1 with
1 great
1 caution
1 when
1 Konwell
1 exclaimed
1 as
1 he
1 raised
1 the
1 flaming
1 pine
1 high
1 above
1 his
1 head
1 and
1 pointed
1 with
1 it
1 in
1 a
1 certain
1 direction
1 See
1 there
1 he
1 is
1 1
1 4
1 This
1 was
1 the
1 first
1 word
1 that
1 had
1 been
1 spoken
1 since
1 we
1 reentered
1 the
1 cavern
1 I
1 looked
1 in
1 the
1 indicated
1 direction
1 and
1 there
1 indeed
1 lay
1 the
1 panther
1 stretched
1 out
1 at
1 full
1 length
1 but
1 no
1 longer
1 dangerous
1 His
1 eyes
1 were
1 set
1 his
1 limbs
1 were
1 rigid
1 -
1 -the
1 last
1 agony
1 was
1 over
1 e
1 skinned
1 and
1 cut
1 him
1 up
1 as
1 he
1 lay
1 All
1 three
1 bullets
1 had
1 struck
1 him
1 and
1 both
1 knives
1 penetrated
1 his
1 body
1 and
1 it
1 must
1 have
1 been
1 in
1 the
1 death
1 -struggle
1 that
1 he
1 leaped
1 upon
1 us
1 1
1 5
1 hen
1 our
1 work
1 was
1 ended
1 and
1 we
1 again
1 came
1 to
1 the
1 open
1 air
1 the
1 sun
1 was
1 low
1 in
1 the
1 horizon
1 and
1 all
1 haste
1 was
1 necessary
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 set
1 out
1 on
1 our
1 forest
1 -path
1 without
1 further
1 delay
1 Our
1 wounds
1 smarted
1 not
1 a
1 little
1 and
1 although
1 we
1 took
1 time
1 once
1 more
1 to
1 wash
1 them
1 they
1 became
1 so
1 stiff
1 that
1 our
1 progress
1 was
1 both
1 toilsome
1 and
1 tedious
1 e
1 soon
1 became
1 convinced
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 not
1 succeed
1 in
1 reaching
1 our
1 companions
1 while
1 daylight
1 remained
1 and
1 we
1 determined
1 to
1 bivouac
1 for
1 the
1 night
1 at
1 the
1 foot
1 of
1 a
1 rocky
1 declivity
1 which
1 promised
1 a
1 good
1 shelter
1 from
1 the
1 cutting
1 wind
1 1
1 6
1 To
1 add
1 to
1 our
1 discomfort
1 hunger
1 began
1 to
1 make
1 itself
1 painfully
1 felt
1 but
1 this
1 was
1 soon
1 overpowered
1 by
1 weariness
1 and
1 having
1 gathered
1 up
1 the
1 dry
1 pine
1 branches
1 we
1 kindled
1 up
1 a
1 good
1 fire
1 and
1 without
1 troubling
1 ourselves
1 to
1 prepare
1 any
1 thing
1 for
1 supper
1 we
1 stretched
1 ourselves
1 on
1 the
1 grass
1 before
1 it
1 and
1 found
1 the
1 warmth
1 most
1 grateful
1 1
1 7
1 orn
1 out
1 by
1 the
1 toils
1 of
1 the
1 day
1 in
1 a
1 few
1 minutes
1 Konwell
1 was
1 fast
1 asleep
1 but
1 although
1 much
1 inclined
1 to
1 follow
1 his
1 example
1 I
1 was
1 prevented
1 by
1 the
1 restlessness
1 of
1 my
1 dog
1 which
1 seemed
1 to
1 wish
1 to
1 warn
1 me
1 of
1 the
1 presence
1 of
1 danger
1 The
1 faithful
1 animal
1 cringing
1 closely
1 to
1 me
1 laid
1 his
1 nose
1 on
1 my
1 shoulder
1 raising
1 his
1 head
1 from
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 and
1 whined
1 as
1 though
1 he
1 wished
1 to
1 communicate
1 something
1 and
1 then
1 for
1 a
1 few
1 moments
1 would
1 remain
1 quiet
1 Then
1 suddenly
1 he
1 would
1 rise
1 up
1 as
1 in
1 the
1 attitude
1 of
1 listening
1 occasionally
1 uttering
1 a
1 low
1 growl
1 1
1 8
1 Completely
1 awakened
1 by
1 this
1 strange
1 behavior
1 on
1 the
1 part
1 of
1 my
1 faithful
1 dog
1 it
1 seemed
1 to
1 me
1 as
1 if
1 I
1 heard
1 a
1 slight
1 rustling
1 among
1 the
1 dry
1 bushes
1 and
1 rising
1 up
1 to
1 a
1 half
1 -sitting
1 posture
1 I
1 looked
1 toward
1 the
1 rock
1 behind
1 me
1 and
1 to
1 my
1 great
1 astonishment
1 became
1 aware
1 of
1 a
1 pair
1 of
1 glaring
1 eyes
1 fastened
1 upon
1 me
1 As
1 my
1 head
1 was
1 between
1 the
1 fire
1 and
1 those
1 fearful
1 eyes
1 I
1 could
1 plainly
1 distinguish
1 the
1 fiery
1 balls
1 as
1 reflected
1 on
1 by
1 the
1 red
1 light
1 they
1 peered
1 above
1 the
1 naked
1 rocks
1 1
1 9
1 It
1 was
1 a
1 panther
1 and
1 evidently
1 from
1 the
1 position
1 in
1 which
1 I
1 saw
1 it
1 was
1 ready
1 for
1 a
1 spring
1 Happily
1 on
1 this
1 as
1 on
1 every
1 other
1 night
1 my
1 trusty
1 gun
1 lay
1 close
1 beside
1 me
1 I
1 seized
1 it
1 and
1 half
1 -rising
1 so
1 that
1 the
1 fire
1 behind
1 me
1 afforded
1 light
1 for
1 a
1 steady
1 aim
1 I
1 leveled
1 it
1 exactly
1 between
1 the
1 eyes
1 I
1 fired
1 the
1 bullet
1 sped
1 on
1 its
1 deadly
1 errand
1 and
1 the
1 crack
1 of
1 the
1 noble
1 rifle
1 thundering
1 against
1 the
1 steep
1 rocks
1 returned
1 with
1 loud
1 and
1 prolonged
1 echo
1 2
1 0
1 Konwell
1 to
1 whom
1 the
1 report
1 of
1 a
1 gun
1 was
1 ever
1 the
1 sweetest
1 music
1 now
1 started
1 up
1 as
1 if
1 roused
1 by
1 an
1 electric
1 shock
1 and
1 grasped
1 his
1 gun
1 The
1 dog
1 continued
1 his
1 barking
1 smelling
1 all
1 around
1 and
1 looking
1 in
1 my
1 face
1 as
1 if
1 to
1 inquire
1 in
1 what
1 direction
1 he
1 should
1 go
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 rustling
1 movement
1 on
1 the
1 rock
1 and
1 the
1 bullet
1 must
1 have
1 taken
1 effect
1 2
1 1
1 Konwell
1 shook
1 his
1 head
1 as
1 he
1 inquired
1 hy
1 I
1 had
1 shot
1 ithout
1 answering
1 I
1 began
1 to
1 reload
1 my
1 gun
1 this
1 finished
1 I
1 took
1 up
1 a
1 blazing
1 pine
1 brand
1 from
1 the
1 fire
1 and
1 proceeded
1 to
1 climb
1 the
1 steep
1 wall
1 of
1 rock
1 that
1 raised
1 itself
1 like
1 a
1 barrier
1 about
1 twenty
1 steps
1 distant
1 from
1 the
1 spot
1 upon
1 which
1 we
1 rested
1 Here
1 I
1 found
1 an
1 old
1 panther
1 the
1 largest
1 I
1 had
1 ever
1 seen
1 lying
1 dead
1 -
1 -my
1 well
1 -directed
1 bullet
1 had
1 finished
1 him
1 I
1 flung
1 the
1 body
1 over
1 the
1 rock
1 and
1 my
1 old
1 comrade
1 dragged
1 him
1 to
1 the

1 2

1 The
1 ball
1 had
1 struck
1 him
1 directly
1 in
1 the
1 right
1 eye
1 passing
1 through
1 the
1 brain
1 He
1 was
1 a
1 fearful
1 -looking
1 animal
1 with
1 terrible
1 teeth
1 and
1 claws
1 and
1 the
1 more
1 to
1 be
1 dreaded
1 as
1 when
1 we
1 cut
1 him
1 up
1 his
1 stomach
1 was
1 found
1 entirely
1 empty
1 I
1 believed
1 that
1 hunger
1 had
1 driven
1 him
1 so
1 close
1 to
1 the
1 fire
1 but
1 Konwell
1 thought
1 he
1 had
1 scented
1 the
1 fresh
1 venison
1 we
1 had
1 with
1 us
1 Be
1 that
1 as
1 it
1 may
1 there
1 was
1 little
1 doubt
1 but
1 that
1 he
1 would
1 have
1 made
1 a
1 leap
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 the
1 intervening
1 fire
1 had
1 burned
1 down
1 to
1 its

1 MUSEUM
1 1
1 Horace
1 and
1 Herman
1 two
1 young
1 men
1 who
1 were
1 friends
1 set
1 out
1 to
1 travel
1 in
1 distant
1 countries
1 Before
1 they
1 departed
1 each
1 had
1 formed
1 a
1 plan
1 of
1 proceeding
1 Horace
1 determined
1 to
1 give
1 himself
1 up
1 entirely
1 to
1 pleasure
1 -
1 -to
1 go
1 wherever
1 his
1 humor
1 might
1 dictate
1 -
1 -and
1 to
1 keep
1 no
1 records
1 of
1 his
1 adventures
1 In
1 short
1 he
1 resolved
1 to
1 enjoy
1 himself
1 as
1 much
1 as
1 possible
1 and
1 by
1 no
1 means
1 to
1 encumber
1 his
1 mind
1 with
1 cares
1 duties
1 or
1 troubles
1 of
1 any
1 kind
1 2
1 Herman
1 was
1 as
1 fond
1 of
1 amusement
1 as
1 Horace
1 but
1 the
1 mode
1 he
1 adopted
1 for
1 the
1 gratification
1 of
1 his
1 wishes
1 was
1 quite
1 different
1 In
1 the
1 first
1 place
1 he
1 made
1 out
1 a
1 scheme
1 of
1 his
1 travels
1 he
1 procured
1 maps
1 read
1 books
1 and
1 after
1 mature
1 deliberation
1 adopted
1 a
1 certain
1 route
1 as
1 most
1 likely
1 to
1 afford
1 him
1 pleasure
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 instruction
1 3
1 In
1 the
1 formation
1 of
1 this
1 plan
1 he
1 spent
1 several
1 weeks
1 and
1 in
1 this
1 occupation
1 he
1 found
1 quite
1 as
1 much
1 satisfaction
1 as
1 he
1 afterwards
1 did
1 in
1 traveling
1 Thus
1 he
1 obtained
1 one
1 great
1 advantage
1 over
1 his
1 idle
1 and
1 luxurious
1 friend
1 who
1 foolishly
1 thought
1 that
1 the
1 essence
1 of
1 enjoyment
1 lay
1 in
1 freedom
1 from
1 thought
1 restraint
1 and
1 toil
1 Even
1 before
1 they
1 set
1 out
1 on
1 their
1 journey
1 Herman
1 had
1 actually
1 found
1 nearly
1 as
1 much
1 pleasure
1 as
1 Horace
1 received
1 in
1 the
1 whole
1 course
1 of
1 his
1 expedition
1 4
1 The
1 two
1 young
1 men
1 started
1 together
1 and
1 as
1 there
1 were
1 then
1 no
1 canals
1 or
1 railroads
1 they
1 both
1 set
1 out
1 on
1 foot
1 They
1 had
1 not
1 proceeded
1 far
1 before
1 they
1 separated
1 -
1 -Horace
1 taking
1 one
1 road
1 and
1 Herman
1 another
1 5
1 After
1 the
1 lapse
1 of
1 three
1 years
1 they
1 both
1 returned
1 but
1 what
1 a
1 difference
1 between
1 them
1 Horace
1 was
1 morose
1 and
1 dissatisfied
1 he
1 had
1 seen
1 a
1 good
1 deal
1 of
1 the
1 world
1 but
1 as
1 he
1 had
1 traveled
1 with
1 no
1 other
1 design
1 than
1 to
1 gratify
1 himself
1 from
1 hour
1 to
1 hour
1 he
1 had
1 soon
1 exhausted
1 the

1 Such
1 was

1 7
1 It

1 Adhering

1 he
1 visited
1 a

1 henever
1 he

1 with

1 to

1 it
1 If
1 it
1 was
1 some
1 aged
1 relic
1 famous
1 in

1 he
1 took
1 pains
1 to
1 investigate
1 its

1 and
1 to
1 write
1 it
1 down
1 If
1 it
1 was
1 an
1 object
1 of
1 interest
1 to
1 the
1 eye
1 he
1 made
1 a
1 sketch
1 of
1 it
1 in
1 a
1 book
1 which
1 he
1 kept
1 for
1 that
1 purpose
1 8
1 In
1 this
1 way
1 Herman
1 accomplished
1 three
1 good
1 objects
1 In
1 the
1 first
1 place
1 by
1 taking
1 pleasure
1 in
1 a
1 moderate
1 way
1 and
1 mixing
1 with
1 it
1 a
1 little
1 toil
1 and
1 industry
1 he
1 prevented
1 that
1 cloying
1 surfeit
1 which
1 at
1 last
1 sickened
1 and
1 disgusted
1 Horace
1 9
1 In
1 the
1 second
1 place
1 he
1 greatly
1 increased
1 his
1 enjoyments
1 by
1 the
1 plan
1 he
1 adopted
1 Merely
1 executing
1 a
1 plan
1 is
1 agreeable
1 and
1 a
1 source
1 of
1 great
1 pleasure
1 It
1 is
1 natural
1 to
1 derive
1 happiness
1 from
1 following
1 out
1 a
1 design
1 -
1 -from
1 seeing
1 hour
1 by
1 hour
1 day
1 by

1 how
1 results
1 come

1 in

1 to

1 1
1 0
1 But
1 this
1 was
1 not
1 the
1 only
1 advantage
1 which
1 Herman
1 received
1 from
1 his
1 system
1 The
1 very
1 toil
1 he
1 bestowed
1 the
1 investigations
1 he
1 made
1 the
1 pleasant
1 thoughts
1 and
1 curious
1 knowledge
1 that
1 were
1 unfolded
1 to
1 his
1 mind
1 the
1 excitement
1 he
1 found
1 in
1 his
1 exertions
1 the
1 pleasure
1 he
1 took
1 in
1 drawing
1 picturesque
1 scenes
1 all
1 constituted
1 a

1 harvest
1 of
1 pleasure
1 which
1 was
1 wholly
1 denied
1 to
1 Horace
1 1
1 1
1 Thus
1 it
1 was
1 that
1 labor
1 and
1 industry
1 exerted
1 in
1 carrying
1 out
1 a
1 plan
1 afforded
1 the
1 young
1 traveler
1 a
1 vast
1 deal
1 of
1 gratification
1 The
1 very
1 things
1 that
1 Horace
1 looked
1 upon
1 as
1 hateful
1 were
1 in
1 fact
1 the
1 sources
1 of
1 his
1 friend
1 s
1 most

1 1
1 2
1 In

1 laden

1 Not

1 was
1 his

1 rich

1 Harmon

1 of

1 s
1 apprentice
1 James
1 allace
1 intending
1 by
1 the
1 question
1 to
1 elicit

1 reply
1 that
1 would
1 exhibit
1 the
1 boy
1 s

1 2
1 James
1 allace
1 a
1 boy
1 of
1 fourteen
1 turned
1 his
1 bright
1 intelligent
1 eyes
1 upon
1 the
1 son
1 of

1 and
1 replied
1 I
1 don

1 know
1 Harmon
1 How
1 far
1 is
1 it
1 3
1 There
1 was
1 something
1 so
1 honest
1 and
1 earnest
1 in
1 the
1 tone
1 of
1 the
1 boy
1 that
1 much
1 as
1 Harmon
1 had
1 felt
1 disposed
1 at
1 first
1 to
1 sport
1 with
1 his
1 ignorance
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 refrain
1 from
1 giving
1 him
1 a
1 true
1 answer
1 Still
1 his
1 contempt
1 for
1 the
1 ignorant
1 apprentice
1 was
1 not
1 to
1 be
1 concealed
1 and
1 he
1 replied
1 Ninety
1 -five
1 millions
1 of
1 miles
1 you
1 ignoramus
1 James
1 did
1 not
1 retort
1 but
1 repeating
1 over
1 in
1 his
1 mind
1 the
1 distance
1 named
1 fixed
1 it
1 indelibly
1 upon
1 his
1 memory
1 4
1 On
1 the
1 same
1 evening
1 after
1 he
1 had
1 finished
1 his
1 day
1 s
1 work
1 he
1 obtained
1 a
1 small
1 text
1 -book
1 on
1 astronomy
1 which
1 belonged
1 to
1 Harmon
1 Lee
1 and
1 went
1 up
1 into
1 his
1 garret
1 with
1 a
1 candle
1 and
1 there
1 alone
1 attempted
1 to
1 dive
1 into
1 the
1 mysteries
1 of
1 that
1 sublime
1 science
1 As
1 he
1 read
1 the
1 earnestness
1 of
1 his
1 attention
1 fixed
1 nearly
1 every
1 fact
1 upon
1 his
1 mind
1 So
1 intent
1 was
1 he
1 that
1 he
1 perceived
1 not
1 the
1 flight
1 of
1 time
1 until
1 the
1 town
1 -clock
1 struck
1 ten
1 5
1 He
1 lay
1 down
1 upon
1 his
1 hard
1 bed
1 and
1 gave
1 full
1 scope
1 to
1 his
1 thoughts
1 Hour
1 after
1 hour
1 passed
1 away
1 but
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 sleep
1 so
1 absorbed
1 was
1 he
1 in
1 reviewing
1 the
1 new
1 and
1 wonderful
1 things
1 he
1 had
1 read
1 At
1 last
1 wearied
1 nature
1 gave
1 way
1 and
1 he
1 fell
1 into
1 a
1 slumber
1 filled
1 with
1 dreams
1 of
1 planets
1 moons
1 comets
1 and
1 fixed
1 stars
1 6
1 The
1 next
1 morning
1 the
1 apprentice
1 boy
1 resumed
1 his
1 place
1 at
1 the
1 work
1 -bench
1 with
1 a
1 new
1 feeling
1 and
1 with
1 this
1 feeling
1 was
1 mingled
1 one
1 of
1 regret
1 that
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 go
1 to
1 school
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 Harmon
1 But
1 I
1 can
1 study
1 at
1 night
1 while
1 he
1 is
1 asleep
1 he
1 said
1 to
1 himself
1 7
1 Just
1 then
1 Harmon
1 Lee
1 came
1 into
1 the
1 shop
1 and
1 approaching
1 James
1 said
1 for
1 the
1 purpose
1 of
1 teasing
1 him
1 How
1 big
1 round
1 is
1 the
1 earth
1 James
1 Twenty
1 -five
1 thousand
1 miles
1 was
1 the
1 quick
1 reply
1 8
1 Harmon
1 looked
1 surprised
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 and
1 then
1 responded
1 with
1 a
1 sneer
1 -
1 -for
1 he
1 was
1 not
1 a
1 kind
1 -hearted
1 boy
1 but
1 on
1 the
1 contrary
1 very
1 selfish
1 and
1 disposed
1 to
1 injure
1 rather
1 than
1 do
1 good
1 to
1 others
1 -
1 -Oh
1 how
1 wonderfully
1 wise
1 you
1 are
1 all
1 at
1 once
1 And
1 no
1 doubt
1 you
1 can
1 tell
1 how
1 many
1 moons
1 Jupiter
1 has
1 Come
1 let
1 us
1 hear
1 9
1 Jupiter
1 has
1 four
1 moons
1 James
1 answered
1 with
1 something
1 of
1 exultation
1 in
1 his
1 tone
1 And
1 no
1 doubt
1 you
1 can
1 tell
1 how
1 many
1 rings
1 it
1 has
1 Jupiter
1 has
1 no
1 rings
1 Saturn
1 has
1 rings
1 and
1 Jupiter
1 belts
1 James
1 replied
1 in
1 a
1 decisive
1 tone
1 1
1 0
1 For
1 a
1 moment
1 or
1 two
1 Harmon
1 was
1 silent
1 with
1 surprise
1 and
1 mortification
1 to
1 think
1 that
1 his
1 father
1 s
1 apprentice
1 whom
1 he
1 esteemed
1 so
1 far
1 below
1 him
1 should
1 be
1 possessed
1 of
1 knowledge
1 equal
1 to
1 his
1 and
1 on
1 the
1 points
1 in
1 reference
1 to
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 chosen
1 to
1 question
1 him
1 -
1 -and
1 that
1 he
1 should
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 convict
1 him
1 of
1 an
1 error
1 into
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 purposely
1 fallen
1 1
1 1
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 to
1 know
1 how
1 long
1 it
1 is
1 since
1 you
1 became
1 so
1 wonderfully
1 wise
1 said
1 Harmon
1 with
1 a
1 sneer
1 Not
1 very
1 long
1 James
1 replied
1 calmly
1 I
1 have
1 been
1 reading
1 one
1 of
1 your
1 books
1 on
1 astronomy
1 1
1 2
1 I
1 should
1 like
1 to
1 know
1 what
1 business
1 you
1 have
1 to
1 touch
1 one
1 of
1 my
1 books
1 You
1 had
1 better
1 be
1 minding
1 your
1 work
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 neglect
1 it
1 Harmon
1 I
1 read
1 at
1 night
1 after
1 I
1 was
1 done
1 with
1 my
1 work
1 and
1 I
1 did
1 not
1 hurt
1 your
1 book
1 I
1 don
1 t
1 care
1 if
1 you
1 didn
1 t
1 hurt
1 it
1 You
1 are
1 not
1 going
1 to
1 have
1 my
1 books
1 I
1 can
1 tell
1 you
1 So
1 you
1 just
1 let
1 them
1 alone
1 1
1 3
1 Poor
1 James
1 s
1 heart
1 sank
1 within
1 him
1 at
1 this
1 unexpected
1 obstacle
1 so
1 suddenly
1 thrown
1 in
1 his
1 way
1 He
1 had
1 no
1 money
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 to
1 buy
1 and
1 knew
1 of
1 no
1 one
1 from
1 whom
1 he
1 could
1 borrow
1 the
1 book
1 that
1 had
1 become
1 so
1 necessary
1 to
1 his
1 happiness
1 Do
1 Harmon
1 he
1 said
1 lend
1 me
1 the
1 book
1 I
1 will
1 take
1 good
1 care
1 of
1 it
1 No
1 I
1 will
1 not
1 And
1 don
1 t
1 you
1 dare
1 to
1 touch
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 angry
1 reply
1 1
1 4
1 James
1 allace
1 knew
1 well
1 enough
1 the
1 selfish
1 disposition
1 of
1 Harmon
1 to
1 be
1 convinced
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 now
1 but
1 little
1 hope
1 of
1 his
1 having
1 the
1 use
1 of
1 his
1 books
1 except
1 by
1 stealth
1 and
1 from
1 that
1 his
1 naturally
1 open
1 and
1 honest
1 principles
1 revolted
1 All
1 day
1 he
1 thought
1 earnestly
1 of
1 the
1 means
1 whereby
1 he
1 should
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 obtain
1 a
1 book
1 on
1 astronomy
1 to
1 quench
1 the
1 ardent
1 thirst
1 he
1 had
1 created
1 in
1 his
1 own
1 mind
1 1
1 5
1 He
1 was
1 learning
1 the
1 trade
1 of
1 a
1 blind
1 -maker
1 Having
1 been
1 already
1 an
1 apprentice
1 for
1 two
1 years
1 and
1 being
1 industrious
1 and
1 intelligent
1 he
1 had
1 acquired
1 a
1 readiness
1 with
1 tools
1 and
1 much
1 skill
1 in
1 some
1 parts
1 of
1 his
1 trade
1 hile
1 sitting
1 alone
1 after
1 he
1 had
1 finished
1 his
1 work
1 for
1 the
1 day
1 it
1 occurred
1 to
1 him
1 that
1 he
1 might
1 by
1 working
1 in
1 the
1 evening
1 earn
1 some
1 money
1 and
1 with
1 it
1 buy
1 such
1 books
1 as
1 he
1 wanted
1 1
1 6
1 By
1 consent
1 of
1 his
1 employer
1 he
1 succeeded
1 in
1 getting
1 a
1 small
1 job
1 from
1 one
1 of
1 his
1 neighbors
1 and
1 in
1 a
1 short
1 time
1 by
1 working
1 evenings
1 he
1 obtained
1 sufficient
1 money
1 to
1 purchase
1 a
1 book
1 of
1 his
1 own
1 and
1 had
1 a
1 half
1 dollar
1 left
1 with
1 which
1 he
1 bought
1 a
1 second
1 -hand
1 dictionary
1 Every
1 night
1 found
1 him
1 poring
1 over
1 his
1 books
1 and
1 as
1 soon
1 as
1 it
1 was
1 light
1 enough
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 to
1 see
1 he
1 was
1 up
1 and
1 reading
1 During
1 the
1 day
1 his
1 mind
1 was
1 pondering
1 over
1 the
1 things
1 he
1 had
1 read
1 while
1 his
1 hands
1 were
1 diligently
1 employed
1 in
1 the
1 labor
1 assigned
1 him
1 1
1 7
1 It
1 occurred
1 just
1 at
1 this
1 time
1 that
1 a
1 number
1 of
1 benevolent
1 individuals
1 established
1 in
1 the
1 town
1 where
1 James
1 lived
1 one
1 of
1 those
1 excellent
1 institutions
1 an
1 Apprentices
1 Library
1 To
1 this
1 he
1 applied
1 and
1 obtained
1 the
1 books
1 he
1 needed
1 And
1 thus
1 did
1 this
1 poor
1 apprentice
1 boy
1 lay
1 the
1 foundation
1 of
1 future
1 eminence
1 and
1 usefulness
1 At
1 the
1 age
1 of
1 twenty
1 -one
1 he
1 was
1 master
1 of
1 his
1 trade
1 and
1 what
1 was
1 more
1 had
1 laid
1 up
1 a
1 vast
1 amount
1 of
1 general
1 and
1 scientific
1 information
1 1
1 8
1 Let
1 us
1 now
1 turn
1 to
1 mark
1 the
1 progress
1 of
1 the
1 young
1 student
1 Harmon
1 Lee
1 in
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 best
1 seminaries
1 in
1 his
1 native
1 city
1 and
1 afterwards
1 at
1 college
1 The
1 idea
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 lawyer
1 soon
1 took
1 possession
1 of
1 his
1 mind
1 and
1 this
1 caused
1 him
1 to
1 feel
1 contempt
1 for
1 other
1 boys
1 who
1 were
1 merely
1 designed
1 for
1 trades
1 or
1 store
1 -keeping
1 1
1 9
1 Like
1 too
1 many
1 others
1 he
1 had
1 no
1 love
1 for
1 learning
1 To
1 be
1 a
1 lawyer
1 he
1 thought
1 would
1 be
1 much
1 more
1 honorable
1 than
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 mere
1 mechanic
1 and
1 for
1 this
1 reason
1 alone
1 he
1 desired
1 to
1 be
1 one
1 As
1 for
1 James
1 allace
1 the
1 poor
1 illiterate
1 apprentice
1 he
1 was
1 most
1 heartily
1 despised
1 and
1 never
1 treated
1 by
1 Harmon
1 with
1 the
1 least
1 degree
1 of
1 kind
1 consideration
1 2
1 0
1 At
1 the
1 age
1 of
1 eighteen
1 Harmon
1 was
1 sent
1 away
1 to
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 eastern
1 universities
1 and
1 there
1 remained
1 until
1 he
1 was
1 twenty
1 years
1 of
1 age
1 when
1 he
1 graduated
1 and
1 came
1 home
1 with
1 the
1 honorary
1 title
1 of
1 Bachelor
1 of
1 Arts
1 On
1 the
1 very
1 day
1 that
1 James
1 completed
1 his
1 term
1 of
1 apprenticeship
1 Harmon
1 was
1 admitted
1 to
1 the
1 bar
1 2
1 1
1 From
1 some
1 cause
1 James
1 determined
1 he
1 would
1 make
1 law
1 his
1 profession
1 To
1 the
1 acquirement
1 of
1 a
1 knowledge
1 of
1 legal
1 matters
1 therefore
1 he
1 bent
1 all
1 the
1 energies
1 of
1 a
1 well
1 disciplined
1 mind
1 Two
1 years
1 passed
1 away
1 in
1 an
1 untiring
1 devotion
1 to
1 the
1 studies
1 he
1 had
1 assigned
1 himself
1 and
1 he
1 then
1 made
1 application
1 for
1 admission
1 to
1 the
1 bar
1 2
1 2
1 Young
1 allace
1 passed
1 his
1 examinations
1 with
1 some
1 applause
1 and
1 the
1 first
1 case
1 on
1 which
1 he
1 was
1 employed
1 chanced
1 to
1 be
1 one
1 of
1 great
1 difficulty
1 which
1 required
1 all
1 his
1 skill
1 the
1 lawyer
1 on
1 the
1 opposite
1 side
1 was
1 Harmon
1 Lee
1 who
1 entertained
1 for
1 his
1 father
1 s
1 apprentice
1 the
1 utmost
1 contempt
1 2
1 3
1 The
1 cause
1 came
1 on
1 There
1 was
1 a

1 silence

1 attention
1 and

1 when
1 the
1 young
1 stranger
1 arose
1 in
1 the
1 court
1 -room
1 to
1 open
1 the
1 case
1 A
1 smile
1 of
1 contempt
1 curled
1 the

1 of
1 Harmon
1 Lee
1 but
1 allace
1 saw
1 it

1 The
1 prominent
1 points
1 of
1 the
1 case
1 were
1 presented
1 in

1 concise
1 language
1 to
1 the

1 and
1 a
1 few
1 remarks
1 bearing
1 upon
1 its
1 merits

1 made
1 the

1 lawyer
1 took
1 his

1 and
1 gave
1 room
1 for
1 the
1 defense
1 2
1 4
1 Instantly
1 Harmon
1 Lee
1 was
1 on
1 his
1 feet
1 and
1 began
1 referring
1 to
1 the
1 points
1 presented
1 by
1 his
1 very
1 learned
1 brother
1 in
1 a
1 very
1 flippant
1 manner
1 There
1 were
1 those
1 present
1 who
1 marked
1 the
1 light
1 that
1 kindled
1 in
1 the
1 eye
1 of
1 allace
1 and
1 the
1 flash
1 that
1 passed
1 over
1 his
1 countenance
1 at
1 the
1 first
1 contemptuous
1 word
1 and
1 tone
1 that
1 were
1 uttered
1 by
1 his
1 antagonist
1 at
1 the
1 bar
1 These
1 soon
1 gave
1 place
1 to
1 attention
1 and
1 an
1 air
1 of
1 conscious
1 power
1 Nearly
1 an
1 hour
1 had
1 passed
1 when
1 Harmon
1 resumed
1 his
1 seat
1 with
1 a
1 look
1 of
1 exultation
1 which
1 was
1 followed
1 by
1 a
1 pitying
1 and
1 contemptuous
1 smile
1 as
1 allace
1 again
1 slowly
1 rose
1 2
1 5
1 Ten
1 minutes
1 however
1 had
1 not
1 passed
1 when
1 that
1 smile
1 had
1 changed
1 to
1 a
1 look
1 of
1 surprise
1 mortification
1 and
1 alarm
1 The
1 young
1 lawyer
1 s
1 first
1 speech
1 showed
1 him
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 man
1 of
1 calm
1 deep
1 systematic
1 thought
1 -
1 -well
1 skilled
1 in
1 points
1 of
1 law
1 and
1 in
1 authorities
1 -
1 -and
1 more

1 a

1 of

1 views
1 hen
1 he
1 sat
1 down
1 no

1 point
1 in

1 and
1 none
1 that

1 been
1 touched
1 required
1 further

1 Lee
1 followed
1 briefly
1 in
1 a
1 vain
1 attempt
1 to
1 torture
1 his
1 language
1 and
1 break
1 down
1 his
1 positions
1 But
1 he
1 felt
1 that
1 he
1 was
1 contending
1 with
1 weapons
1 whose
1 edges
1 were
1 turned
1 at
1 every
1 blow
1 hen
1 he
1 took
1 his
1 seat
1 again
1 allace
1 merely
1 remarked
1 that

1 without

1 argument
1 to
1 submit
1 the
1 case
1 to
1 the

1 The

1 was

1 submitted

1 unhesitatingly
1 made
1 in

1 of

1 From

1 The

1 apprentice
1 became
1 the

1 profound
1 lawyer
1 and
1 was

1 for

1 Oh
1 you
1 re

1 said
1 a
1 little
1 boy
1 the
1 other
1 day
1 tauntingly
1 to
1 his
1 companion
1 The
1 boy
1 addressed
1 turned
1 proudly
1 round
1 and
1 while
1 the
1 fire
1 of
1 injured
1 pride
1 and
1 the
1 look
1 of
1 pity
1 were
1 strangely
1 blended
1 in
1 his
1 countenance
1 coolly
1 answered
1 So
1 was
1 Franklin
1 2
1 This
1 dignified
1 reply
1 struck
1 me
1 forcibly
1 and
1 I
1 turned
1 to
1 mark
1 the
1 disputants
1 more
1 closely
1 The
1 former
1 I
1 perceived
1 by
1 his
1 dress
1 was
1 of
1 a
1 higher
1 class
1 in
1 society
1 than
1 his
1 humble
1 yet
1 more
1 dignified
1 companion
1 The
1 latter
1 was
1 a
1 sprightly
1 active
1 lad
1 scarce
1 twelve
1 years
1 old
1 and
1 coarsely
1 but
1 neatly
1 attired
1 But
1 young
1 as
1 he
1 was
1 there
1 was
1 visible
1 in
1 his
1 countenance
1 much
1 of
1 genius
1 manly
1 dignity
1 and
1 determinate
1 resolution
1 while
1 that
1 of
1 the
1 former
1 showed
1 only
1 fostered
1 pride
1 and
1 the
1 imagined
1 superiority
1 of
1 riches
1 3
1 That
1 little
1 fellow
1 thought
1 we
1 gazing
1 at
1 our
1 young
1 hero
1 displays
1 already
1 much
1 of
1 the
1 man
1 though
1 his
1 calling
1 be
1 a
1 humble
1 one
1 and
1 though
1 poverty
1 extends
1 to
1 him
1 her
1 dreary
1 cheerless
1 reality
1 still
1 he
1 looks
1 on
1 the
1 brightest
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 scene
1 and
1 already
1 rises
1 in
1 anticipation
1 from
1 poverty
1 and
1 wretchedness
1 Once
1 so
1 was
1 Franklin
1 and
1 the
1 world
1 may
1 one
1 day
1 witness
1 in
1 our
1 little
1 prentice
1 as
1 great
1 a
1 philosopher
1 as
1 they
1 have
1 already
1 seen
1 in
1 his
1 noble
1 pattern
1 And
1 we
1 passed
1 on
1 buried
1 in
1 meditation
1 4
1 The
1 motto
1 of
1 our
1 infantile
1 philosopher
1 contains
1 much
1 -
1 -too
1 much
1 to
1 be
1 forgotten
1 and
1 should
1 be
1 engraven
1 on
1 the
1 minds
1 of
1 all
1 hat
1 can
1 better
1 cheer
1 man
1 in

1 calling
1 than
1 the
1 reflection
1 that
1 the
1 greatest
1 and
1 the
1 best
1 of
1 earth
1 -
1 -the
1 greatest
1 statesmen
1 the

1 but

1 could

1 He
1 struggled
1 against
1 a
1 harder
1 current
1 than
1 most
1 are
1 called
1 to
1 encounter
1 but
1 he

1 He

1 At

1 he
1 beat

1 Into

1 In
1 the
1 early
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 war
1 a
1 sergeant
1 and
1 twelve
1 armed
1 men
1 undertook
1 a
1 journey
1 through
1 the
1 wilderness
1 in
1 the
1 State
1 of
1 New
1 Hampshire
1 Their
1 route
1 was
1 remote
1 from
1 any
1 settlement
1 and
1 they
1 were
1 under
1 the
1 necessity
1 of
1 encamping
1 over
1 night
1 in
1 the
1 woods
1 Nothing
1 material
1 happened
1 the
1 first
1 day
1 of
1 their
1 excursion
1 but
1 early
1 in
1 the
1 afternoon
1 of
1 the
1 second
1 they
1 from
1 an
1 eminence
1 discovered
1 a
1 body
1 of
1 armed
1 Indians
1 advancing
1 toward
1 them
1 whose
1 number
1 rather
1 exceeded
1 their
1 own
1 2
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 the
1 whites
1 were
1 perceived
1 by
1 their
1 red
1 brethren
1 the
1 latter
1 made
1 signals
1 and
1 the
1 two
1 parties
1 approached
1 each
1 other
1 in
1 an
1 amicable
1 manner
1 The
1 Indians
1 appeared
1 to
1 be
1 much
1 gratified
1 with
1 meeting
1 the
1 sergeant
1 and
1 his
1 men
1 whom
1 they
1 observed
1 they
1 considered
1 as
1 their
1 protectors
1 They
1 said
1 they
1 belonged
1 to
1 a
1 tribe
1 which
1 had
1 raised
1 the
1 hatchet
1 with
1 zeal
1 in
1 the
1 cause
1 of
1 liberty
1 and
1 were
1 determined
1 to
1 do
1 all
1 in
1 their
1 power
1 to
1 repel
1 the
1 common
1 enemy
1 3
1 They
1 shook
1 hands
1 in
1 friendship
1 hen
1 they
1 had
1 conversed
1 with
1 each
1 other
1 for
1 some
1 time
1 and
1 exchanged
1 mutual
1 good
1 wishes
1 they
1 at
1 length
1 separated
1 and
1 each
1 party
1 traveled
1 in
1 a
1 different
1 direction
1 After
1 proceeding
1 to
1 the
1 distance
1 of
1 a
1 mile
1 or
1 more
1 the
1 sergeant
1 who
1 was
1 acquainted
1 with
1 all
1 the
1 different
1 tribes
1 and
1 knew
1 on
1 which
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 contest
1 they
1 were
1 respectively
1 ranked
1 halted
1 his
1 men
1 and
1 addressed
1 them
1 in
1 the
1 following
1 words
1 4
1 My
1 brave
1 companions
1 we
1 must
1 use
1 the
1 utmost
1 caution
1 or
1 this
1 night
1 may
1 be
1 our
1 last
1 Should
1 we
1 not
1 make
1 some
1 extraordinary
1 exertions
1 to
1 defend
1 ourselves
1 to
1 -morrow
1 s
1 sun
1 may
1 find
1 us
1 sleeping
1 never
1 to
1 wake
1 You
1 are
1 surprised
1 comrades
1 at
1 my
1 words
1 and
1 your
1 anxiety
1 will
1 not
1 be
1 lessened
1 when
1 I
1 inform
1 you
1 that
1 we
1 have
1 just
1 passed
1 our
1 most
1 inveterate
1 foe
1 who
1 under
1 the
1 mask
1 of
1 pretended
1 friendship
1 which
1 you
1 have
1 witnessed
1 would
1 lull
1 us
1 to
1 security
1 and
1 by
1 such
1 means
1 in
1 the
1 unguarded
1 moments
1 of
1 our
1 midnight
1 slumber
1 without
1 resistance
1 seal
1 our
1 fate
1 5
1 The
1 men
1 with
1 astonishment
1 listened
1 to
1 this
1 short
1 harangue
1 and
1 their
1 surprise
1 was
1 greater
1 as
1 not
1 one
1 of
1 them
1 had
1 entertained
1 the
1 suspicion
1 but
1 that
1 they
1 had
1 just
1 encountered
1 friends
1 They
1 all
1 immediately
1 resolved
1 to
1 enter
1 into
1 some
1 scheme
1 for
1 their
1 mutual
1 preservation
1 and
1 the
1 destruction
1 of
1 their
1 enemies
1 By
1 the
1 proposal
1 of
1 their
1 leader
1 the
1 following
1 plan
1 was
1 adopted
1 and
1 executed
1 6
1 The
1 spot
1 selected
1 for
1 their
1 night
1 s
1 encampment
1 was
1 near
1 a
1 stream
1 of
1 water
1 which
1 served
1 to
1 cover
1 their
1 rear
1 They
1 felled
1 a
1 large
1 tree
1 before
1 which
1 on
1 the
1 approach
1 of
1 night
1 a
1 brilliant
1 fire
1 was
1 lighted
1 Each
1 individual
1 cut
1 a
1 log
1 of
1 wood
1 about
1 the
1 size
1 of
1 his
1 body
1 rolled
1 it
1 nicely
1 in
1 his
1 blanket
1 placed
1 his
1 hat
1 upon
1 one
1 end
1 and
1 laid
1 it
1 before
1 the
1 fire
1 that
1 the
1 enemy
1 might
1 be
1 deceived
1 and
1 mistake
1 it
1 for
1 a
1 man
1 7
1 After
1 they
1 had
1 thus
1 fitted
1 out
1 logs
1 equal
1 in
1 number
1 to
1 the
1 sergeant
1 s
1 party
1 and
1 had
1 so
1 artfully
1 arranged
1 them
1 that
1 they
1 might
1 be
1 easily
1 mistaken
1 for
1 so
1 many
1 soldiers
1 the
1 men
1 with
1 loaded
1 muskets
1 placed
1 themselves
1 behind
1 the
1 fallen
1 tree
1 by
1 which
1 time
1 the
1 shades
1 of
1 evening
1 began
1 to
1 close
1 around
1 The
1 fire
1 was
1 kept
1 burning
1 brilliantly
1 until
1 late
1 in
1 the
1 evening
1 when
1 it
1 was
1 suffered
1 to
1 decline
1 8
1 The
1 critical
1 time
1 was
1 now
1 approaching
1 when
1 an
1 attack
1 might
1 be
1 expected
1 from
1 the
1 Indians
1 but
1 the
1 sergeant
1 s
1 men
1 rested
1 in
1 their
1 place
1 of
1 concealment
1 with
1 great
1 anxiety
1 till
1 near
1 midnight
1 without
1 perceiving
1 any
1 movement
1 of
1 the
1 enemy
1 At
1 length
1 a
1 tall
1 Indian
1 was
1 discovered
1 through
1 the
1 glimmering
1 of
1 the
1 fire
1 cautiously
1 moving
1 toward
1 them
1 making
1 no
1 noise
1 and
1 apparently
1 using
1 every
1 means
1 in
1 his
1 power
1 to
1 conceal
1 himself
1 from
1 any
1 one
1 about
1 the
1 camp
1 9
1 For
1 a
1 time
1 his
1 actions
1 showed
1 him
1 to
1 be
1 suspicious
1 that
1 a
1 guard
1 might
1 be
1 stationed
1 to
1 watch
1 any
1 unusual
1 appearance
1 who
1 would
1 give
1 the
1 alarm
1 in
1 case
1 of
1 danger
1 but
1 all
1 appearing
1 quiet
1 he
1 ventured
1 forward
1 more
1 boldly
1 rested
1 upon
1 his
1 toes
1 and
1 was
1 distinctly
1 seen
1 to
1 move
1 his
1 finger
1 as
1 he
1 numbered
1 each
1 log
1 of
1 wood
1 or
1 what
1 he
1 supposed
1 to
1 be
1 a
1 human
1 being
1 quietly
1 enjoying
1 repose
1 1
1 0
1 To
1 satisfy
1 himself
1 more
1 fully
1 as
1 to
1 the
1 number
1 he
1 counted
1 them
1 over
1 a
1 second
1 time
1 and
1 cautiously
1 retired
1 He
1 was
1 succeeded
1 by
1 another
1 Indian
1 who
1 went
1 through
1 the
1 same
1 movements
1 and
1 retired
1 in
1 the
1 same
1 manner
1 Soon
1 after
1 the
1 whole
1 party
1 sixteen
1 in
1 number
1 were
1 discovered
1 approaching
1 and
1 greedily
1 eyeing
1 their
1 supposed
1 victims
1 1
1 1
1 The
1 feelings
1 of
1 the
1 sergeant
1 s
1 men
1 can
1 be
1 better
1 imagined
1 than
1 described
1 when
1 they
1 saw
1 the
1 base
1 and
1 cruel
1 purpose
1 of
1 their
1 enemies
1 who
1 were
1 now
1 so
1 near
1 that
1 they
1 could
1 scarcely
1 be
1 restrained
1 from
1 firing
1 upon
1 them
1 The
1 plan
1 however
1 of
1 the
1 sergeant
1 was
1 to
1 have
1 his
1 men
1 remain
1 silent
1 in
1 their
1 places
1 of
1 concealment
1 till
1 the
1 muskets
1 of
1 the
1 savages
1 were
1 discharged
1 that
1 their
1 own
1 fire
1 might
1 be
1 effectual
1 and
1 opposition
1 less
1 formidable
1 1
1 2
1 Their
1 suspense
1 was
1 not
1 of
1 long
1 duration
1 The
1 Indians
1 in
1 a
1 body
1 cautiously
1 approached
1 till
1 within
1 a
1 short
1 distance
1 they
1 then
1 halted
1 took
1 deliberate
1 aim
1 discharged
1 their
1 pieces
1 upon
1 inanimate
1 logs
1 gave
1 a
1 dreadful
1 war
1 -whoop
1 and
1 instantly
1 rushed
1 forward
1 with
1 tomahawk
1 and
1 scalping
1 knife
1 in
1 hand
1 to
1 dispatch
1 the
1 living
1 and
1 obtain
1 the
1 scalps
1 of
1 the
1 dead
1 1
1 3
1 As
1 soon
1 as
1 they
1 had
1 collected
1 in
1 close
1 order
1 more
1 effectually
1 to
1 execute
1 their
1 horrid
1 intentions
1 the
1 sergeant
1 s
1 party
1 discharged
1 their
1 pieces
1 not
1 on
1 logs
1 of
1 wood
1 but
1 perfidious
1 savages
1 -
1 -many
1 of
1 whom
1 fell
1 under
1 the
1 hot
1 fire
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 band
1 and
1 the
1 rest
1 precipitately
1 fled
1 But
1 for
1 this
1 ingenious
1 scheme
1 it
1 is
1 probable
1 that
1 not
1 one
1 of
1 these
1 twelve
1 men
1 would
1 have
1 escaped
1 the
1 tomahawk
1 of
1 the
1 savages

1 passed
1 the
1 evening
1 with
1 the
1 venerable
1 Joseph
1 Slocum
1 whose
1 family
1 was
1 among
1 the
1 sufferers
1 in
1 yoming
1 Valley
1 He
1 related
1 to
1 me
1 all
1 the
1 particulars
1 of
1 the
1 capture
1 and
1 final
1 discovery
1 of

1 2
1 His

1 was
1 a
1 Quaker
1 and
1 was

1 for
1 his
1 kindness
1 to
1 the
1 Indians
1 He
1 remained
1 unharmed
1 at
1 the
1 time
1 of
1 the
1 invasion
1 and
1 while
1 the
1 torch
1 was
1 applied
1 to
1 the
1 dwellings
1 of

1 his
1 was
1 left
1 untouched
1 But
1 his
1 son
1 Giles
1 was
1 in
1 the
1 battle
1 This
1 doubtless
1 excited
1 the
1 ire
1 of
1 the
1 Indians
1 and
1 they
1 resolved
1 on
1 vengeance
1 3
1 Late
1 in
1 the
1 autumn
1 they
1 were
1 seen
1 prowling
1 about
1 the
1 house
1 which
1 was
1 situated
1 about
1 one
1 hundred
1 rods
1 from
1 the
1 ilkesbarre
1 Fort
1 A

1 named
1 Kingsley
1 had

1 and

1 had
1 a
1 welcome
1 home
1 in
1 Mr
1 Slocum
1 s

1 One
1 morning
1 the
1 boys
1 were
1 grinding
1 a
1 knife
1 near
1 the
1 house
1 when
1 a
1 rifle
1 -shot
1 and
1 a
1 shriek
1 brought
1 Mrs
1 Slocum
1 to
1 the
1 door
1 An
1 Indian
1 was
1 scalping
1 the
1 eldest
1 boy
1 a
1 lad
1 of
1 fifteen
1 with
1 the
1 knife
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 grinding
1 4
1 The
1 savage
1 then
1 went
1 into
1 the
1 house
1 and
1 caught
1 up
1 a
1 little
1 son
1 of

1 See
1 exclaimed
1 the
1 frightened
1 mother
1 he

1 he

1 The
1 Indian
1 released
1 the
1 boy
1 took
1 up
1 her
1 little
1 daughter
1 Frances
1 aged
1 five
1 years
1 gently
1 in
1 his
1 arms
1 and
1 seizing
1 the
1 younger
1 Kingsley
1 hastened
1 to
1 the
1 mountains
1 5
1 Two
1 Indians
1 who
1 were
1 with

1 carried

1 girl
1 about
1 seventeen
1 years

1 Mr

1 brother
1 Joseph
1 my

1 two
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 years
1 old
1 and
1 fled
1 in
1 safety
1 to
1 the
1 fort
1 where
1 an
1 alarm
1 was
1 given
1 but
1 the
1 savages
1 were
1 beyond
1 successful
1 pursuit
1 6
1 About
1 six
1 weeks
1 afterward
1 Mr
1 Slocum
1 and
1 his
1 father
1 -in

1 Ira
1 Tripp
1 were
1 shot
1 and
1 scalped
1 by
1 some
1 Indians
1 while
1 foddering
1 cattle
1 near
1 the
1 house
1 Again
1 the
1 savages
1 escaped
1 with
1 their
1 horrid
1 trophies
1 Mrs
1 Slocum
1 bereft
1 of
1 father
1 husband
1 and
1 child
1 and
1 stripped
1 of

1 but
1 the

1 nine
1 helpless
1 children

1 yet
1 in

1 household
1 7
1 She
1 trusted
1 in

1 of

1 and
1 if
1 she
1 was
1 not
1 fed
1 by
1 the
1 ravens
1 she
1 was
1 spared
1 by
1 the

1 She
1 mourned
1 not
1 for

1 they

1 little
1 Frances
1 her
1 lost

1 where

1 The

1 kept

1 but
1 years
1 rolled

1 was
1 established
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 little
1 captive
1 s
1 brothers
1 started
1 in
1 search
1 of
1 her
1 They
1 traversed
1 the
1 wilderness
1 to
1 Niagara
1 offering
1 rewards
1 for
1 her
1 recovery
1 but
1 all
1 in
1 vain
1 They
1 returned
1 to
1 yoming
1 convinced
1 that
1 the
1 child
1 was
1 dead
1 But
1 the
1 mother
1 s
1 heart
1 was
1 still
1 the
1 shrine
1 of
1 hope
1 and
1 she
1 felt
1 assured
1 that
1 Frances
1 was
1 not
1 in
1 the
1 grave
1 9
1 Her
1 soul
1 appeared
1 to

1 passed
1 and

1 if

1 must
1 have
1 arrived
1 to
1 womanhood
1 was
1 found
1 among
1 the
1 Indians

1 took

1 it
1 does

1 The

1 the

1 returned

1 From
1 time
1 to
1 time
1 the
1 hope
1 of
1 the
1 mother
1 would
1 be

1 and

1 settlements
1 in
1 search
1 of

1 lost
1 sister

1 in

1 The

1 went

1 Her

1 intelligence
1 of

1 an

1 from
1 Logansport
1 Indiana
1 to
1 the
1 editor
1 of

1 Intelligencer
1 gave
1 such
1 information
1 that
1 all
1 doubts
1 respecting

1 identity
1 were
1 removed
1 and
1 Joseph
1 Slocum
1 with
1 the
1 sister
1 who
1 carried
1 him
1 to
1 the

1 and

1 where

1 brother
1 Isaac
1 1
1 3
1 They
1 proceeded
1 to
1 Logansport
1 where
1 they
1 found
1 Mr
1 Ewing
1 and
1 ascertained
1 that
1 the
1 woman
1 spoken
1 of
1 by
1 him
1 lived
1 about
1 twelve
1 miles
1 from
1 the
1 village
1 She
1 was
1 immediately
1 sent
1 for
1 and
1 toward
1 evening
1 the
1 next
1 day
1 she
1 came
1 into
1 the
1 town
1 riding
1 a
1 spirited
1 young
1 horse
1 accompanied
1 by
1 her
1 two
1 daughters
1 and

1 An

1 was
1 procured
1 for
1 she
1 could
1 not
1 speak
1 or
1 understand
1 English
1 and
1 she
1 listened
1 seriously
1 to
1 what
1 her
1 brothers
1 had
1 to
1 say
1 She
1 answered
1 but
1 little
1 and
1 at
1 sunset
1 departed
1 for
1 her
1 home
1 promising
1 to
1 return
1 the
1 next
1 morning
1 The
1 brother
1 and
1 sister
1 were
1 quite
1 sure
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 indeed
1 Frances
1 though
1 in
1 her
1 face
1 nothing

1 lineaments
1 were
1 seen

1 alone
1 revealing

1 1
1 5
1 True
1 to

1 appointment
1 she
1 appeared
1 the
1 following
1 morning
1 accompanied
1 as
1 before
1 Mr
1 Joseph
1 Slocum
1 then
1 mentioned
1 a
1 mark
1 of
1 recognition
1 which
1 his
1 mother
1 had
1 said
1 was
1 a
1 sure
1 test
1 hile
1 playing
1 one
1 day
1 with
1 a
1 hammer
1 in
1 a
1 blacksmith
1 s
1 shop
1 Joseph
1 then
1 a
1 child
1 two
1 and
1 a
1 half
1 years
1 old
1 gave
1 Frances
1 a
1 blow
1 upon
1 the
1 middle
1 finger
1 of
1 the

1 hand
1 which
1 crushed

1 1

1 This

1 Mr

1 should
1 fail
1 hen
1 he
1 mentioned
1 it
1 the

1 was
1 greatly
1 agitated
1 and
1 while
1 tears
1 filled
1 the
1 furrows
1 of
1 her
1 face
1 she
1 held
1 out
1 the
1 wounded
1 finger
1 There
1 was
1 no
1 longer
1 a
1 doubt
1 and
1 a
1 scene
1 of
1 great
1 interest
1 ensued
1 Her
1 affections
1 for
1 her
1 kindred
1 that
1 had
1 slumbered
1 half
1 a
1 century
1 were
1 aroused
1 and
1 she
1 made
1 earnest
1 inquiries
1 after

1 father

1 Her

1 heart
1 -

1 country
1 The
1 first
1 night

1 of

1 in

1 For

1 and
1 removed
1 to

1 country
1 She
1 was
1 treated
1 with
1 more
1 respect
1 than
1 the
1 Indian
1 women
1 generally
1 and
1 so
1 happy
1 was

1 the
1 chance
1 of
1 being
1 discovered
1 and
1 compelled
1 to

1 was

1 a

1 to

1 the

1 after

1 was
1 more

1 than

1 the

1 said

1 Naoman
1 then
1 proceeded
1 to
1 tell

1 that
1 owing
1 to
1 some
1 encroachments
1 of
1 the

1 below

1 his

1 sought
1 her
1 husband
1 who

1 told

1 and
1 as

1 to

1 they
1 proceeded
1 to
1 their
1 boat
1 which
1 was

1 filled
1 with
1 water
1 It
1 took
1 some
1 time
1 to
1 clear

1 and
1 meanwhile
1 Stacy
1 recollected

1 proceeded

1 They

1 She

1 by

1 a
1 dream
1 the
1 night
1 before
1 which
1 alarmed

1 1

1 she

1 was

1 and
1 motionless
1 A
1 pause

1 was
1 an

1 who
1 though

1 soured

1 with

1 he
1 never
1 acknowledged
1 a

1 or
1 forgave
1 an

1 More
1 than
1 this
1 he
1 sought

1 plotting

1 against

1 3
1 Soon
1 after

1 he

1 General

1 at

1 4
1 He
1 wrote

1 what

1 would

1 in

1 General
1 Clinton
1 was

1 thought
1 an

1 divided
1 against

1 must
1 prove
1 an

1 and

1 to

1 Andre

1 The

1 My

1 the

1 in

1 tone
1 of

1 hate
1 -
1 -My
1 brother
1 cried
1 for
1 quarter
1 on

1 even

1 clinched
1 in

1 hate
1 He
1 paused
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 and
1 then
1 pinioned
1 the
1 Tory
1 s
1 arms
1 and
1 with
1 one
1 rapid
1 stride
1 dragged
1 him
1 to
1 the

1 and

1 gasped
1 the
1 Tory
1 turning

1 Then
1 the
1 Continental
1 with
1 his
1 muscular
1 strength
1 gathered
1 for
1 the
1 effort
1 shook
1 the
1 murderer
1 once
1 more
1 over
1 the

1 and
1 then
1 hissed
1 this

1 sneer
1 between

1 -
1 -My

1 The

1 in

1 of

1 was
1 taken
1 in

1 Tory
1 He

1 and

1 After

1 the
1 patriot
1 soldier
1 consented
1 He
1 bound
1 the
1 Tory
1 s
1 arms
1 yet
1 tighter
1 placed
1 him
1 on
1 the
1 rock
1 again
1 and

1 up
1 the

1 A

1 imbosomed
1 among

1 They
1 entered

1 There
1 beside

1 sat
1 the

1 and

1 She
1 was
1 a

1 woman
1 of
1 about
1 thirty
1 years
1 with
1 a

1 faded
1 by

1 and
1 long
1 disheveled
1 hair

1 On

1 And
1 then
1 that
1 pale
1 -faced
1 Tory
1 flung
1 himself
1 on
1 his
1 knees
1 confessed
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 butchered
1 her
1 husband
1 on
1 the
1 night
1 of
1 Pa
1 o

1 for

1 in
1 a
1 cold
1 icy
1 tone

1 froze
1 the

1 Look
1 The
1 Bible
1 lies
1 open
1 before
1 me
1 I
1 will
1 close

1 shall

1 upon
1 a

1 and

1 This
1 was
1 a

1 proposal
1 made
1 in

1 faith
1 of
1 a

1 and

1 superstition
1 of

1 the

1 Raising

1 the

1 to

1 son
1 She
1 closed
1 the

1 to

1 reddened
1 with
1 loathing
1 as
1 he
1 gazed
1 upon
1 his
1 father
1 s
1 murderer
1 He
1 took
1 the

1 pages
1 at

1 and
1 placed
1 his

1 Then

1 soldier
1 who

1 his

1 s

1 stood
1 there
1 with

1 and

1 Then
1 the
1 culprit
1 kneeling
1 on

1 with
1 a
1 face
1 like
1 discolored
1 clay
1 felt

1 leap
1 to

1 Then
1 in
1 a
1 clear
1 bold
1 voice
1 the
1 widow
1 read
1 this
1 line
1 from
1 the

1 It
1 was
1 short

1 terrible
1 That

1 to

1 into

1 but
1 the

1 pinioned
1 as

1 the
1 scene
1 a
1 piece
1 of
1 forest
1 land
1 in
1 the
1 north
1 of
1 Virginia
1 near
1 a
1 noble
1 stream
1 of
1 water
1 Implements
1 of
1 surveying
1 were
1 lying
1 about
1 and
1 several
1 men
1 reclining
1 under
1 the
1 trees
1 betokened
1 by
1 their
1 dress
1 and
1 appearance
1 that
1 they
1 composed
1 a
1 party
1 engaged
1 in
1 laying
1 out
1 the
1 wild
1 lands
1 of
1 the
1 country
1 2
1 These
1 persons
1 had
1 apparently
1 just
1 finished
1 their
1 dinner
1 Apart
1 from
1 the
1 group
1 walked
1 a
1 young
1 man
1 of
1 a
1 tall
1 and
1 compact
1 frame
1 and
1 moved
1 with
1 the
1 elastic
1 tread
1 of
1 one
1 accustomed
1 to
1 constant
1 exercise
1 in
1 the
1 open
1 air
1 His
1 countenance
1 wore
1 a
1 look
1 of
1 decision
1 and
1 manliness
1 not
1 usually
1 found
1 in
1 one
1 so
1 young
1 for
1 he
1 was
1 apparently
1 little
1 over
1 eighteen
1 years
1 of
1 age
1 His
1 hat
1 had
1 been
1 cast
1 off
1 as
1 if
1 for
1 comfort
1 and
1 he
1 had
1 paused
1 with
1 one
1 foot
1 advanced
1 in
1 a
1 graceful
1 and
1 natural
1 attitude
1 3
1 Suddenly
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 shriek
1 then
1 another
1 and
1 several
1 in
1 rapid
1 succession
1 The
1 voice
1 was
1 that
1 of
1 a
1 woman
1 and
1 seemed
1 to
1 proceed
1 from
1 the
1 other
1 side
1 of
1 a
1 dense
1 thicket
1 At
1 the
1 first
1 scream
1 the
1 youth
1 turned
1 his
1 head
1 in
1 the
1 direction
1 of
1 the
1 sound
1 but
1 when
1 it
1 was
1 repeated
1 he
1 pushed
1 aside
1 the
1 undergrowth
1 which
1 separated
1 him
1 from
1 it
1 and
1 quickening
1 his
1 footsteps
1 as
1 the
1 cries
1 succeeded
1 each
1 other
1 in
1 alarming
1 rapidity
1 he
1 soon
1 dashed
1 into
1 an
1 open
1 space
1 on
1 the
1 banks
1 of
1 the
1 stream
1 where
1 stood
1 a
1 rude
1 log
1 -cabin
1 4
1 As
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 broke
1 from
1 the
1 undergrowth
1 he
1 saw
1 his
1 companions
1 crowded
1 together
1 on
1 the
1 banks
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 while
1 in
1 the
1 midst
1 stood
1 the
1 woman
1 from
1 whom
1 proceeded
1 the
1 shrieks
1 held
1 back
1 by
1 two
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 but
1 struggling
1 vigorously
1 for
1 freedom
1 It
1 was
1 but
1 the
1 work
1 of
1 a
1 moment
1 for
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 to
1 make
1 his
1 way
1 through
1 the
1 crowd
1 and
1 confront
1 the
1 female
1 The
1 instant
1 her
1 eye
1 fell
1 on
1 him
1 she
1 exclaimed
1 Oh
1 sir
1 you
1 will
1 do
1 something
1 for
1 me
1 Make
1 them
1 release
1 me
1 -
1 -for
1 the
1 love
1 of
1 God
1 My
1 boy
1 -
1 -my
1 poor
1 boy
1 is
1 drowning
1 and
1 they
1 will
1 not
1 let
1 me
1 go
1 It
1 would
1 be
1 madness
1 she
1 will
1 jump
1 into
1 the
1 river
1 said
1 one
1 and
1 the
1 rapids
1 would
1 dash
1 her
1 to
1 pieces
1 in
1 a
1 moment
1 5
1 The
1 youth
1 had
1 scarcely
1 waited
1 for
1 these
1 words
1 for
1 he
1 recollected
1 the
1 child
1 a
1 bold
1 little
1 boy
1 of
1 four
1 years
1 old
1 whose
1 beautiful
1 blue
1 eyes
1 and
1 flaxen
1 ringlets
1 made
1 him
1 a
1 favorite
1 with
1 all
1 who
1 knew
1 him
1 He
1 had
1 been
1 accustomed
1 to
1 play
1 in
1 the
1 little
1 inclosure
1 before
1 the
1 cabin
1 but
1 the
1 gate
1 having
1 been
1 left
1 open
1 he
1 had
1 stolen
1 incautiously
1 out
1 reached
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 bank
1 and
1 was
1 in
1 the
1 act
1 of
1 looking
1 over
1 when
1 his
1 mother
1 saw
1 him
1 6
1 The
1 shriek
1 she
1 uttered
1 only
1 hastened
1 the
1 catastrophe
1 she
1 feared
1 for
1 the
1 child
1 frightened
1 at
1 the
1 cry
1 of
1 its
1 mother
1 lost
1 its
1 balance
1 and
1 fell
1 into
1 the
1 stream
1 which
1 here
1 went
1 foaming
1 and
1 roaring
1 along
1 amid
1 innumerable
1 rocks
1 constituting
1 the
1 most
1 dangerous
1 rapids
1 known
1 in
1 that
1 section
1 of
1 the
1 country
1 Scream
1 now
1 followed
1 scream
1 in
1 rapid
1 succession
1 as
1 the
1 agonized
1 mother
1 rushed
1 to
1 the
1 bank
1 7
1 The
1 party
1 we
1 left
1 reclining
1 in
1 the
1 shade
1 within
1 a
1 few
1 steps
1 of
1 the
1 accident
1 were
1 immediately
1 on
1 the
1 spot
1 Fortunate
1 it
1 was
1 that
1 they
1 were
1 so
1 near
1 else
1 the
1 mother
1 would
1 have
1 jumped
1 in
1 after
1 her
1 child
1 and
1 both
1 been
1 lost
1 Several
1 of
1 the
1 men
1 approached
1 the
1 brink
1 and
1 were
1 on
1 the
1 point
1 of
1 springing
1 in
1 after
1 the
1 child
1 when
1 the
1 sight
1 of
1 the
1 sharp
1 rocks
1 crowding
1 the
1 channel
1 the
1 rush
1 and
1 whirl
1 of
1 the
1 waters
1 and
1 the
1 want
1 of
1 any
1 knowledge
1 where
1 to
1 look
1 for
1 the
1 boy
1 deterred
1 them
1 and
1 they
1 gave
1 up
1 the
1 enterprise
1 8
1 Not
1 so
1 with
1 the
1 noble
1 youth
1 His
1 first
1 work
1 was
1 to
1 throw
1 off
1 his
1 coat
1 next
1 to
1 spring
1 to
1 the
1 edge
1 of
1 the
1 bank
1 Here
1 he
1 stood
1 for
1 a
1 moment
1 running
1 his
1 eyes
1 rapidly
1 over
1 the
1 scene
1 below
1 taking
1 with
1 a
1 glance
1 the
1 different
1 currents
1 and
1 the
1 most
1 dangerous
1 of
1 the
1 rocks
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 shape
1 his
1 course
1 when
1 in
1 the
1 stream
1 He
1 had
1 scarcely
1 formed
1 his
1 conclusion
1 when
1 he
1 saw
1 in
1 the
1 water
1 a
1 white
1 object
1 which
1 he
1 knew
1 to
1 be
1 the
1 boy
1 s
1 dress
1 and
1 he
1 plunged
1 into
1 the
1 wild
1 and
1 roaring
1 rapids
1 9
1 Thank
1 God
1 he
1 will
1 save
1 my
1 child
1 cried
1 the
1 mother
1 there
1 he
1 is
1 -
1 -oh
1 my
1 boy
1 my
1 darling
1 boy
1 how
1 could
1 I
1 leave
1 you
1 Every
1 one
1 had
1 rushed
1 to
1 the
1 brink
1 of
1 the
1 precipice
1 and
1 was
1 now
1 following
1 with
1 eager
1 eyes
1 the
1 progress
1 of
1 the
1 youth
1 as
1 the
1 current
1 bore
1 him
1 onward
1 like
1 a
1 feather
1 in
1 the
1 embrace
1 of
1 the
1 hurricane
1 Now
1 it
1 seemed
1 as
1 if
1 he
1 would
1 be
1 dashed
1 against
1 a
1 jutting
1 rock
1 over
1 which
1 the
1 water
1 flew
1 in
1 foam
1 and
1 a
1 whirlpool
1 would
1 drag
1 him
1 in
1 from
1 whose
1 grasp
1 escape
1 would
1 appear
1 impossible
1 1
1 0
1 At
1 times
1 the
1 current
1 bore
1 him
1 under
1 and
1 he
1 would
1 be
1 lost
1 to
1 sight
1 then
1 just
1 as
1 the
1 spectators
1 gave
1 him
1 up
1 he
1 would
1 appear
1 though
1 far
1 from
1 where
1 he
1 vanished
1 still
1 buffeting
1 amid
1 the
1 vortex
1 Oh
1 how
1 that
1 mother
1 s
1 straining
1 eyes
1 followed
1 him
1 in
1 his
1 perilous
1 career
1 how
1 her
1 heart
1 sunk
1 when
1 he
1 went
1 under
1 -
1 -and
1 with
1 what
1 a
1 gush
1 of
1 joy
1 when
1 she
1 saw
1 him
1 emerge
1 again
1 from
1 the
1 waters
1 and
1 flinging
1 the
1 waves
1 aside
1 with
1 his
1 athletic
1 arms
1 struggle
1 on
1 in
1 pursuit
1 of
1 her
1 boy
1 1
1 1
1 But
1 it
1 seemed
1 as
1 if
1 his
1 generous
1 efforts
1 were
1 not
1 to
1 avail
1 for
1 though
1 the
1 current
1 was
1 bearing
1 off
1 the
1 boy
1 before
1 his
1 eyes
1 scarcely
1 ten
1 feet
1 distant
1 he
1 could
1 not
1 despite
1 his
1 gigantic
1 efforts
1 overtake
1 the
1 drowning
1 child
1 On
1 flew
1 the
1 youth
1 and
1 child
1 and
1 it
1 was
1 miraculous
1 how
1 each
1 escaped
1 being
1 dashed
1 in
1 pieces
1 against
1 the
1 rocks
1 Twice
1 the
1 boy
1 went
1 out
1 of
1 sight
1 and
1 a
1 suppressed
1 shriek
1 escaped
1 the
1 mother
1 s
1 lips
1 but
1 twice
1 he
1 reappeared
1 and
1 then
1 with
1 hands
1 wrung
1 wildly
1 together
1 and
1 breathless
1 anxiety
1 she
1 followed
1 his
1 progress
1 as
1 his
1 unresisting
1 form
1 was
1 hurried
1 with
1 the
1 onward
1 current
1 1
1 2
1 The
1 youth
1 now
1 appeared
1 to
1 redouble
1 his
1 exertions
1 for
1 they
1 were
1 approaching
1 the
1 most
1 dangerous
1 part
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 where
1 the
1 rapids
1 contracting
1 between
1 the
1 narrow
1 shores
1 shot
1 almost
1 perpendicularly
1 down
1 a
1 declivity
1 of
1 fifteen
1 feet
1 The
1 rush
1 of
1 the
1 waters
1 at
1 this
1 spot
1 was
1 tremendous
1 and
1 no
1 one
1 ventured
1 to
1 approach
1 its
1 vicinity
1 even
1 in
1 a
1 canoe
1 lest
1 he
1 should
1 be
1 dashed
1 in
1 pieces
1 hat
1 then
1 would
1 be
1 the
1 youth
1 s
1 fate
1 unless
1 he
1 soon
1 overtook
1 the
1 child
1 He
1 seemed
1 fully
1 sensible
1 of
1 the
1 increasing
1 peril
1 and
1 now
1 urged
1 his
1 way
1 through
1 the
1 foaming
1 current
1 with
1 a
1 desperate
1 strength
1 1
1 3
1 Three
1 times
1 he
1 was
1 on
1 the
1 point
1 of
1 grasping
1 the
1 child
1 when
1 the
1 waters
1 whirled
1 the
1 prize
1 from
1 him
1 The
1 third
1 effort
1 was
1 made
1 just
1 as
1 they
1 were
1 entering
1 within
1 the
1 influence
1 of
1 the
1 current
1 above
1 the
1 fall
1 and
1 when
1 it
1 failed
1 the
1 mother
1 s
1 heart
1 sunk
1 within
1 her
1 and
1 she
1 groaned
1 fully
1 expecting
1 the
1 youth
1 to
1 give
1 up
1 his
1 task
1 But
1 no
1 he
1 only
1 pressed
1 forward
1 the
1 more
1 eagerly
1 and
1 as
1 they
1 breathlessly
1 watched
1 amid
1 the
1 boiling
1 waters
1 they
1 saw
1 the
1 form
1 of
1 the
1 brave
1 youth
1 following
1 close
1 after
1 that
1 of
1 the
1 boy
1 1
1 4
1 And
1 now
1 like
1 an
1 arrow
1 from
1 the
1 bow
1 pursuer
1 and
1 pursued
1 shot
1 to
1 the
1 brink
1 of
1 the
1 precipice
1 An
1 instant
1 they
1 hung
1 there
1 distinctly
1 visible
1 amid
1 the
1 foaming
1 waters
1 Every
1 brain
1 grew
1 dizzy
1 at
1 the
1 sight
1 But
1 a
1 shout
1 of
1 involuntary
1 exultation
1 burst
1 from
1 the
1 spectators
1 when
1 they
1 saw
1 the
1 boy
1 held
1 aloft
1 by
1 the
1 right
1 arm
1 of
1 the
1 youth
1 -
1 -a
1 shout
1 that
1 was
1 suddenly
1 checked
1 with
1 horror
1 when
1 they
1 both
1 vanished
1 into
1 the
1 abyss
1 below
1 1
1 5
1 A
1 moment
1 elapsed
1 before
1 a
1 word
1 was
1 spoken
1 or
1 a
1 breath
1 drawn

1 which
1 the

1 and
1 farther
1 toward

1 we

1 sadness
1 belongs

1 on

1 of
1 a
1 South
1 -seaman
1 cruising
1 in
1 the

1 Pacific
1 ocean
1 He
1 may

1 over
1 some

1 may

1 sailing
1 gently

1 over
1 the

1 solemnly
1 still
1 with
1 the
1 sun
1 pouring
1 its
1 intense
1 rays
1 with
1 dazzling
1 brightness
1 Suddenly
1 the
1 monotonous
1 quietude
1 is
1 broken
1 by
1 an
1 animated
1 voice
1 from
1 the
1 masthead
1 exclaiming
1 There
1 he
1 spouts

1 The
1 captain
1 starts
1 on
1 deck
1 in
1 an
1 instant
1 and
1 inquires
1 here
1 away
1 but
1 perhaps
1 the
1 next
1 moment
1 every
1 one
1 aloft
1 and
1 on
1 deck
1 can
1 perceive
1 an
1 enormous
1 whale
1 lying
1 about
1 a
1 quarter
1 of
1 a
1 mile
1 from
1 the
1 ship
1 on
1 the
1 surface
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 having
1 just
1 come
1 up
1 to
1 breathe
1 -
1 -his
1 large
1 hump
1 projecting
1 three
1 feet
1 out
1 of
1 the
1 water
1 At
1 the
1 end
1 of
1 every
1 ten
1 seconds
1 the
1 spout
1 is
1 seen
1 rushing
1 from
1 the
1 fore
1 part
1 of
1 his
1 enormous
1 head
1 followed
1 by
1 the
1 cry
1 of
1 every
1 one
1 on
1 board
1 who
1 join
1 in

1 keeping
1 time

1 the

1 of

1 But
1 while
1 they
1 have
1 been
1 looking
1 a
1 few
1 seconds
1 have
1 expired
1 They
1 rush
1 into
1 the
1 boats
1 which
1 are
1 directly
1 lowered
1 to
1 receive
1 them
1 and
1 in
1 two
1 minutes
1 from
1 the
1 time
1 of
1 first
1 observing
1 the
1 whale
1 three
1 or
1 four
1 boats
1 are
1 down
1 and
1 are
1 darting
1 through
1 the
1 water
1 with
1 their
1 utmost
1 speed
1 toward
1 their
1 intended
1 victim
1 perhaps
1 accompanied
1 with
1 a
1 song
1 from
1 the
1 headsman
1 who
1 urges
1 the
1 quick
1 and
1 powerful
1 plying
1 of
1 the
1 oar
1 with
1 the
1 common
1 whaling
1 chant

1 my
1 boys
1 tis
1 time
1 for

1 to
1 go

1 But
1 while
1 they
1 are
1 rushing
1 along
1 the
1 whale
1 is
1 breathing
1 they
1 have
1 yet
1 perhaps
1 some
1 distance
1 to
1 pull
1 before
1 they
1 can
1 get
1 a
1 chance
1 of
1 striking
1 him
1 with
1 the
1 harpoon
1 His
1 spoutings
1 are
1 nearly
1 out
1 he
1 is
1 about
1 to
1 descend
1 or
1 he
1 hears
1 the
1 boats
1 approaching
1 The
1 few
1 sailors
1 left
1 on
1 board
1 and
1 who
1 are
1 anxiously
1 watching
1 the
1 whale
1 and
1 the
1 gradual
1 approach
1 of
1 the
1 boats
1 exclaim
1 Ah
1 he
1 is
1 going
1 down
1 Yet
1 he
1 spouts
1 again
1 but
1 slowly
1 the
1 water
1 is
1 seen
1 agitated
1 around
1 him
1 the
1 spectators
1 on
1 board
1 with
1 breathless
1 anxiety
1 think
1 they
1 perceive
1 him
1 rising
1 in
1 preparation
1 for
1 his
1 descent
1 He
1 will
1 be
1 lost
1 they
1 exclaim
1 for
1 the
1 boats
1 are
1 not
1 yet
1 near
1 enough
1 to
1 strike
1 him
1 and
1 the
1 men
1 are
1 still
1 bending
1 their
1 oars
1 in
1 each
1 boat
1 with
1 all
1 their
1 strength
1 to
1 claim
1 the
1 honor
1 of
1 the
1 first

1 The
1 bow
1 -boat
1 has
1 the
1 advantage
1 of
1 being
1 the
1 nearest
1 to
1 the
1 whale
1 the
1 others
1 for
1 fear
1 of
1 disturbing
1 the
1 unconscious
1 monster
1 are
1 now
1 ordered
1 to
1 drop
1 astern
1 One
1 more
1 spout
1 is
1 seen
1 slowly
1 curling
1 forth
1 -
1 -it
1 is
1 his
1 last
1 but
1 the
1 boat
1 shoots
1 rapidly
1 alongside
1 of
1 the
1 gigantic
1 creature
1 Peak
1 your

1 exclaims
1 the
1 mate
1 and
1 directly
1 they
1 flourish
1 in
1 the
1 air
1 the
1 glistening
1 harpoon
1 is
1 seen
1 above
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the
1 harpooner
1 In
1 an
1 instant
1 it
1 is
1 darted
1 with
1 unerring
1 force
1 and
1 aim
1 and
1 is
1 buried
1 deeply
1 in
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 the
1 huge
1 animal
1 It
1 is

1 up
1 that

1 buried
1 in

1 which
1 admits

1 A
1 cheer
1 from
1 those
1 in
1 the
1 boats
1 and
1 from
1 the
1 seamen
1 on
1 board
1 reverberates
1 along
1 the
1 still
1 deep
1 at
1 the
1 same
1 moment
1 The
1 sea
1 which
1 a
1 moment
1 before
1 was
1 unruffled
1 now
1 becomes
1 lashed
1 into
1 foam
1 by
1 the
1 immense
1 strength
1 of
1 the
1 wounded
1 whale
1 which
1 with
1 its
1 vast
1 tail
1 strikes
1 in
1 all
1 directions
1 at
1 his
1 enemies
1 Now
1 his
1 enormous
1 head
1 rises
1 high
1 into
1 the
1 air
1 then
1 his
1 flukes
1 are
1 seen
1 lashing
1 everywhere
1 his
1 huge
1 body
1 writhes
1 in
1 violent
1 contortions
1 from
1 the
1 agony
1 the
1 harpoon
1 has
1 inflicted
1 The
1 water
1 all
1 around

1 is
1 a

1 from

1 on

1 but
1 the

1 suddenly
1 disappears

1 has
1 sounded
1 the
1 line
1 is
1 running
1 through
1 the
1 groove
1 at
1 the
1 head
1 of
1 the

1 with
1 lightning

1 unperceived
1 9
1 At
1 length
1 the
1 spring
1 came
1 and
1 a
1 number
1 of

1 They
1 had
1 advanced
1 across

1 the
1 Black
1 River
1 and
1 by
1 carrying
1 their
1 canoes
1 around
1 falls
1 and
1 rapids
1 gently
1 floated
1 down
1 the
1 stream
1 till
1 they
1 reached
1 the
1 great
1 falls
1 about
1 six
1 miles
1 from
1 the
1 Lake
1 Here
1 they
1 halted
1 for

1 night
1 and

1 about

1 a
1 mile
1 above
1 the
1 falls

1 The
1 morning
1 came
1 and
1 as
1 the
1 first
1 beam
1 of
1 the
1 rising
1 sun
1 pierced
1 the
1 forest
1 shade
1 the
1 party
1 again
1 embarked
1 in
1 their
1 canoes
1 for
1 the
1 mouth
1 of
1 the
1 river
1 the
1 gaudy
1 canoe

1 taking
1 the

1 had
1 scarcely
1 started
1 from
1 the
1 shore
1 ere
1 the
1 sharp
1 twang
1 of
1 a
1 bow
1 -string
1 was
1 heard
1 from
1 the
1 shore
1 and
1 an
1 unerring
1 arrow
1 pierced
1 the
1 heart
1 of
1 Eagle
1 Eye
1 He
1 fell
1 over
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 the

1 and
1 was
1 swept
1 by
1 the
1 current
1 over
1 the
1 great
1 falls
1 1

1 The
1 party
1 immediately
1 started
1 in
1 pursuit
1 of
1 the
1 coward
1 murderer
1 but
1 they
1 sought
1 in
1 vain
1 His
1 hiding
1 -place
1 was
1 too
1 sure
1 -
1 -he
1 had
1 taken
1 refuge
1 in
1 a
1 cave
1 the
1 entrance
1 of
1 which
1 was
1 hid
1 from
1 observation
1 by
1 a
1 thick
1 clump
1 of

1 Here
1 he
1 remained
1 till
1 he
1 was

1 the
1 company
1 had
1 departed
1 This

1 revenged
1 Oneida
1 chief
1 Having
1 been
1 apprised
1 of
1 the
1 expedition
1 he
1 had
1 warily
1 dogged
1 the
1 steps
1 of
1 the
1 party
1 until
1 a
1 favorable
1 opportunity
1 presented
1 itself
1 and

1 satisfied

1 upon
1 the
1 enemy
1 whom
1 he
1 did
1 not
1 dare
1 to

1 far
1 and

1 but
1 as
1 no

1 could

1 the

1 with

1 silence
1 hastened

1 fell
1 into

1 found

1 into

1 little
1 boy

1 she
1 sought
1 the
1 shore
1 and
1 fastening

1 proceeded
1 below

1 Eagle

1 Many
1 of

1 who

1 advanced
1 beyond
1 the
1 period
1 of
1 childhood
1 went
1 out
1 from
1 home
1 to
1 embark
1 on
1 the
1 stormy
1 sea
1 of
1 life
1 Of
1 the
1 feelings
1 of
1 a
1 father
1 and
1 of
1 his
1 interest
1 in
1 our
1 welfare
1 we
1 have
1 never
1 entertained
1 a
1 doubt
1 and
1 our
1 home
1 was
1 dear
1 because
1 he
1 was
1 there
1 but
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 peculiarity
1 in
1 the
1 feeling
1 that
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 home
1 of
1 our
1 mother
1 here
1 she
1 lived
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 place
1 that
1 we
1 felt
1 was
1 home
1 There
1 was
1 one
1 place
1 where
1 we
1 would
1 always
1 be
1 welcome
1 one
1 place
1 where
1 we
1 would
1 be
1 met
1 with
1 a
1 smile
1 one
1 place
1 where
1 we
1 would
1 be
1 sure
1 of
1 a
1 friend
1 2
1 The
1 world
1 might
1 be
1 indifferent
1 to
1 us
1 e
1 might
1 be
1 unsuccessful
1 in
1 our
1 studies
1 or
1 our
1 business
1 The
1 new
1 friends
1 which
1 we
1 supposed
1 we
1 had
1 made
1 might
1 prove
1 to
1 be
1 false
1 The
1 honor
1 which
1 we
1 thought
1 we
1 deserved
1 might
1 be
1 withheld
1 from
1 us
1 e
1 might
1 be
1 chagrined
1 and
1 mortified
1 by
1 seeing
1 a
1 rival
1 outstrip
1 us
1 and
1 bear
1 away
1 the
1 prize
1 which
1 we
1 sought
1 But
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 place
1 where
1 no
1 feelings
1 of
1 rivalry
1 were
1 found
1 and
1 where
1 those
1 whom
1 the
1 world
1 overlooked
1 would
1 be
1 sure
1 of
1 a
1 friendly
1 greeting
1 hether
1 pale
1 and

1 by
1 study
1 care
1 or
1 sickness
1 or
1 flushed
1 with
1 health
1 and
1 flattering
1 success
1 we
1 were
1 sure
1 that
1 we
1 should
1 be
1 welcome
1 there
1 3
1 Though
1 the
1 world
1 was
1 cold
1 toward
1 us
1 yet
1 there
1 was
1 one
1 who
1 always
1 rejoiced
1 in
1 our
1 success
1 and
1 always
1 was
1 affected
1 in
1 our
1 reverses
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 place
1 to
1 which
1 we
1 might
1 go
1 back
1 from
1 the
1 storm
1 which
1 began
1 to
1 pelt
1 us
1 where
1 we
1 might
1 rest
1 and
1 become
1 encouraged
1 and
1 invigorated
1 for
1 a
1 new
1 conflict
1 So
1 have
1 I
1 seen
1 a
1 bird
1 in
1 its
1 first
1 efforts
1 to
1 fly
1 leave
1 its
1 nest
1 and
1 stretch
1 its
1 wings
1 and
1 go
1 forth
1 to
1 the
1 wide
1 world
1 But
1 the
1 wind
1 blew
1 it
1 back
1 and
1 the
1 rain
1 began
1 to
1 fall
1 and
1 the
1 darkness
1 of
1 night
1 began
1 to
1 draw
1 on
1 and
1 there
1 was
1 no
1 shelter
1 abroad
1 and
1 it
1 sought
1 its
1 way
1 back
1 to
1 its
1 nest
1 to
1 take
1 shelter
1 beneath
1 its
1 mother
1 s
1 wings
1 and
1 to
1 be
1 refreshed
1 for
1 the
1 struggles
1 of
1 a
1 new
1 day
1 but
1 then
1 it
1 flew
1 away
1 to
1 think
1 of
1 its
1 nest
1 and
1 its
1 mother
1 no
1 more
1 4
1 But
1 not
1 thus
1 did
1 we
1 leave
1 our
1 home
1 when
1 we
1 bade
1 adieu
1 to
1 it
1 to
1 go
1 forth
1 alone
1 to
1 the
1 manly
1 duties
1 of
1 life
1 Even
1 amidst
1 the
1 storms
1 that
1 then
1 beat
1 upon
1 us
1 and
1 the
1 disappointments
1 that
1 we
1 met
1 with
1 and
1 the
1 coldness
1 of
1 the
1 world
1 we
1 felt
1 still
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 one
1 who
1 sympathized
1 in
1 our
1 troubles
1 as
1 well
1 as
1 rejoiced
1 in
1 our
1 success
1 and
1 that
1 whatever
1 might
1 be
1 abroad
1 when
1 we
1 entered
1 the
1 door
1 of
1 her
1 dwelling
1 we
1 should
1 be

1 with

1 This
1 is
1 a

1 period
1 in

1 To
1 me
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 disgusting
1 sights
1 in

1 world
1 is
1 that
1 of
1 a
1 young
1 man
1 with
1 healthy
1 blood
1 broad
1 shoulders
1 and
1 a
1 hundred
1 and
1 fifty
1 pounds

1 or
1 less
1 of

1 bone
1 and
1 muscle
1 standing
1 with
1 his
1 hands
1 in
1 his
1 pockets
1 longing
1 for
1 help
1 I
1 admit
1 that
1 there
1 are
1 positions
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 most
1 independent
1 spirit
1 may
1 accept
1 of
1 assistance
1 -
1 -may
1 in
1 fact
1 as
1 a
1 choice
1 of
1 evils
1 desire
1 it
1 but
1 for
1 a
1 man
1 who
1 is
1 able
1 to
1 help
1 himself
1 to
1 desire
1 the
1 help
1 of
1 others
1 in
1 the
1 accomplishment
1 of
1 his
1 plans
1 of
1 life
1 is
1 positive
1 proof
1 that
1 he
1 has
1 received
1 a
1 most
1 unfortunate
1 training
1 or
1 that
1 there
1 is
1 a

1 with
1 the
1 regular
1 channels
1 of
1 business
1 effort

1 enterprise
1 This
1 is
1 perhaps
1 one
1 of
1 the
1 most
1 difficult
1 to
1 learn
1 of
1 all
1 the
1 lessons
1 of
1 life
1 It
1 is
1 natural
1 for
1 the
1 mind
1 to
1 reach
1 out
1 eagerly
1 for
1 immediate
1 results
1 1
1 1
1 As
1 manhood
1 dawns
1 and
1 the
1 young
1 man
1 catches
1 in
1 its
1 first
1 light
1 the
1 pinnacles
1 of
1 realized
1 dreams
1 the
1 golden
1 domes
1 of
1 high
1 possibilities
1 and
1 the
1 purpling
1 hills
1 of

1 delights
1 and
1 then
1 looks
1 down
1 upon
1 the
1 narrow
1 sinuous
1 long
1 and
1 dusty
1 path
1 by
1 which
1 others
1 have
1 reached
1 them
1 he
1 is
1 apt
1 to
1 be
1 disgusted
1 with
1 the
1 passage
1 and
1 to
1 seek
1 for
1 success
1 through
1 broader
1 channels
1 by
1 quicker
1 means
1 Beginning
1 at
1 the
1 very
1 foot
1 of
1 the
1 hill
1 and
1 working
1 slowly
1 to
1 the
1 top
1 seems
1 a
1 very
1 discouraging
1 process
1 and
1 precisely
1 at
1 this
1 point
1 have
1 thousands
1 of
1 young
1 men
1 made
1 shipwreck
1 of
1 their
1 lives
1 1
1 2
1 Let
1 this
1 be
1 understood
1 then
1 at
1 starting
1 that
1 the
1 patient
1 conquest
1 of
1 difficulties
1 which
1 rise
1 in
1 the
1 regular
1 and
1 legitimate
1 channels
1 of
1 business
1 and
1 enterprise
1 is
1 not
1 only
1 essential
1 in
1 securing
1 the
1 successes
1 which
1 you
1 seek
1 but
1 it
1 is

1 to
1 that

1 of
1 your
1 mind
1 requisite
1 for
1 the
1 enjoyment
1 of
1 your
1 successes
1 and
1 for
1 retaining
1 them
1 when
1 gained
1 It
1 is
1 the
1 general
1 rule
1 of
1 Providence
1 the
1 world
1 over
1 and
1 in
1 all
1 time
1 that
1 unearned
1 success
1 is
1 a
1 curse
1 It
1 is
1 the
1 rule
1 of

1 that
1 the

1 shall

1 and

1 Since
1 you
1 desire
1 to
1 make

1 esteemed
1 and

1 it
1 is

1 you
1 think
1 to
1 render
1 yourself
1 useful
1 to
1 the
1 public
1 Assuredly
1 Tell
1 me
1 then
1 I
1 beseech
1 you
1 what
1 is
1 the
1 first
1 service
1 that
1 you
1 intend
1 to
1 render
1 the

1 As
1 Glaucon
1 appeared
1 to
1 be
1 perplexed
1 and
1 considered
1 what
1 he
1 ought
1 to
1 answer
1 -
1 -Probably
1 replied
1 Socrates
1 it
1 will
1 be
1 to
1 enrich
1 the
1 republic
1 that
1 is
1 to
1 say
1 to
1 increase
1 its
1 revenues
1 Exactly
1 so
1 And
1 undoubtedly
1 you
1 know
1 in
1 what
1 the
1 revenues
1 of
1 the
1 state
1 consist
1 and
1 the
1 extent
1 to
1 which
1 they
1 may
1 be
1 increased
1 You
1 will
1 not
1 have
1 failed
1 to
1 make
1 it
1 a
1 private
1 study
1 to
1 the
1 end
1 that
1 if
1 one
1 source
1 should
1 suddenly
1 fail
1 you
1 may
1 be
1 able
1 to
1 supply
1 its
1 place
1 immediately
1 with
1 another
1 I
1 assure
1 you
1 answered
1 Glaucon
1 that
1 this
1 is
1 what
1 I
1 have
1 never
1 thought
1 of
1 5
1 Tell
1 me
1 at
1 least
1 then
1 the
1 necessary
1 expenses
1 of
1 maintaining
1 the
1 republic
1 You
1 can
1 not
1 fail
1 to
1 know
1 of
1 what
1 importance
1 it
1 is
1 to
1 retrench
1 those
1 which
1 are
1 superfluous
1 I
1 confess
1 to
1 you
1 that
1 I
1 am
1 not
1 more
1 instructed
1 with
1 regard
1 to
1 this
1 article
1 than
1 the
1 other
1 Then
1 it
1 is
1 necessary
1 to
1 defer
1 till
1 another
1 time
1 the
1 design
1 that
1 you
1 have
1 of
1 enriching
1 the
1 republic
1 for
1 it
1 is
1 impossible
1 for
1 you
1 to
1 benefit
1 the
1 state
1 while
1 you
1 are
1 ignorant
1 of
1 its
1 revenues
1 and
1 expenses
1 6
1 But
1 said
1 Glaucon
1 there
1 is
1 still
1 another
1 means
1 that
1 you
1 pass
1 over
1 in
1 silence
1 -
1 -one
1 can
1 enrich
1 a
1 state
1 by
1 the
1 ruin
1 of
1 its
1 enemies
1 You
1 are
1 right
1 replied
1 Socrates
1 but
1 in
1 order
1 to
1 do
1 that
1 you
1 must
1 be
1 the
1 more
1 powerful
1 otherwise
1 you
1 run
1 the
1 risk
1 of
1 losing
1 that
1 which
1 you
1 possess
1 So
1 he
1 who
1 speaks
1 of
1 undertaking
1 a
1 war
1 ought
1 to
1 know
1 the
1 power
1 of
1 both
1 parties
1 to
1 the
1 end
1 that
1 if
1 he
1 finds
1 his
1 party
1 the
1 stronger
1 he
1 may
1 boldly
1 risk
1 the
1 adventure
1 but
1 if
1 he
1 find
1 it
1 the
1 weaker
1 he
1 should
1 dissuade
1 the
1 people
1 from
1 undertaking
1 it
1 7
1 But
1 do
1 you
1 know
1 what
1 are
1 the
1 forces
1 of
1 our
1 republic
1 by
1 sea
1 and
1 by
1 land
1 and
1 what
1 are
1 those
1 of
1 our
1 enemies
1 have
1 you
1 a
1 statement
1 of
1 them
1 in
1 writing
1 You
1 will
1 do
1 me
1 the
1 pleasure
1 to
1 allow
1 me
1 a
1 perusal
1 of
1 it
1 I
1 have

1 replied
1 Glaucon
1 I
1 see
1 then
1 said
1 Socrates
1 that
1 we
1 shall
1 not
1 make
1 war
1 so
1 soon
1 if
1 they

1 to

1 The
1 sage
1 mentioned
1 many
1 other
1 articles
1 not
1 less
1 important
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 found
1 Glaucon
1 equally
1 inexperienced
1 and
1 he
1 pointed
1 out
1 how
1 ridiculous
1 they
1 render
1 themselves
1 who
1 have
1 the
1 rashness
1 to
1 intermeddle
1 with

1 without

1 should
1 blind
1 you
1 and

1 to

1 A

1 Ocean

1 at

1 a

1 mass
1 of

1 Each

1 seemed
1 to
1 plead

1 1
1 1
1 The
1 work

1 But
1 we

1 knew
1 by

1 rising
1 -water
1 through
1 which
1 we

1 that
1 the

1 Small

1 for

1 The

1 The

1 remained

1 now
1 it

1 be

1 that

1 when

1 Meanwhile

1 from

1 men
1 A

1 impulse
1 could

1 For

1 In

1 had
1 become
1 entangled
1 in

1 of

1 and

1 drifted

1 The

1 Even
1 as

1 the

1 No

1 Some

1 at

1 a

1 The

1 sometimes
1 held

1 then
1 was
1 dashed
1 hopelessly
1 out
1 of

1 rising
1 and
1 falling
1 on

1 waves
1 A

1 So
1 she
1 gradually
1 filled

1 they
1 turn

1 brother
1 Lawrence
1 6
1 In
1 those

1 those
1 deep
1 -wooded

1 he
1 had
1 hunted
1 when
1 a
1 stripling
1 by
1 the
1 side
1 of
1 old
1 Lord
1 Fairfax
1 here
1 he
1 took
1 his

1 lessons
1 in

1 of

1 to

1 he

1 side
1 here
1 he
1 indulged
1 the
1 agricultural
1 tastes
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 delighted
1 here
1 resigned
1 his
1 Cincinnatus
1 vocation
1 and
1 bade
1 adieu
1 to
1 his
1 cherished
1 home
1 at
1 the
1 summons
1 of
1 his
1 country
1 7
1 Here
1 his
1 wife
1 received
1 the
1 letter
1 which
1 told
1 her
1 that
1 he
1 had
1 been
1 appointed
1 Commander
1 -in

1 of

1 here

1 -when
1 with
1 tears
1 coursing
1 down
1 his

1 he

1 uttered
1 a
1 touching
1 farewell
1 -
1 -bestowed

1 benediction
1 on
1 the
1 American
1 army
1 and
1 resigned
1 all

1 -
1 -
1 here
1 he
1 returned
1 thinking
1 to
1 resume
1 the
1 rural
1 pursuits
1 that
1 charmed
1 him
1 and
1 to
1 end
1 his
1 days
1 in

1 8
1 Here
1 are
1 the

1 the

1 he
1 planted
1 with

1 here
1 are

1 transplanted
1 still

1 to

1 Here
1 the

1 hangs

1 Here
1 flocked
1 the

1 of
1 all
1 climes
1 and
1 were
1 received
1 with
1 warm
1 unpretending
1 almost
1 rustic
1 hospitality
1 Here
1 the
1 French
1 Houdon
1 modeled
1 his
1 statue
1 and
1 the
1 English
1 Pine
1 painted
1 his
1 portrait
1 and
1 caused
1 that

1 remark
1 I

1 hackneyed
1 to

1 Then
1 came

1 Thousands

1 I
1 not

1 the

1 Don

1 Is
1 there
1 any
1 one
1 so
1 foolish
1 he
1 asks
1 as
1 to
1 believe
1 that
1 there
1 are
1 antipodes
1 with
1 their
1 feet
1 opposite
1 to
1 ours
1 -
1 -that
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 part
1 of
1 the

1 in
1 which
1 all

1 are
1 topsy

1 and
1 where
1 it
1 rains
1 hails
1 and
1 snows
1 upward
1 Col
1 I
1 have
1 already
1 answered
1 this
1 objection
1 If
1 there
1 are
1 people
1 on
1 the
1 earth
1 who
1 are
1 our
1 antipodes
1 it
1 should
1 be
1 remembered
1 that
1 we
1 are
1 theirs
1 also
1 Don
1 G
1 Really
1 that
1 is
1 the
1 very
1 point
1 wherein
1 we
1 matter
1 -of

1 men
1 abide
1 by
1 the
1 assurance
1 of
1 our

1 that
1 we
1 are
1 not
1 walking
1 with
1 our
1 heads

1 Isa
1 To
1 cut
1 short
1 the
1 discussion
1 you
1 think
1 that
1 the
1 enterprise
1 which
1 the
1 Genoese
1 proposes
1 is
1 one
1 unworthy

1 that
1 his
1 theory

1 of

1 is
1 a

1 Don
1 G
1 As
1 a

1 matter

1 man
1 I
1 must
1 confess
1 that
1 I
1 so
1 regard
1 it
1 Has
1 your

1 ever
1 seen
1 an
1 ambassador
1 from
1 this
1 unknown
1 coast
1 Isa
1 Don

1 do
1 you
1 believe

1 Have
1 you
1 ever

1 Don
1 G
1 Certainly
1 not
1 By
1 faith
1 we
1 look

1 to
1 it
1 Isa
1 Even
1 so
1 by

1 to

1 undiscovered

1 Col
1 Your
1 majesty
1 is
1 right
1 but
1 let
1 it
1 be
1 added
1 that
1 I
1 have
1 reasons
1 oh
1 most
1 potent
1 and
1 resistless
1 reasons
1 for
1 the
1 faith
1 that
1 is
1 in
1 me
1 the
1 testimony
1 of
1 many
1 navigators
1 who
1 have
1 picked
1 up
1 articles
1 that
1 must
1 have
1 drifted
1 from
1 this
1 distant

1 the
1 nature
1 of
1 things
1 admitting
1 that
1 the
1 earth
1 is
1 round
1 the

1 among
1 the
1 people
1 of
1 one
1 of
1 the

1 many
1 years
1 ago
1 their
1 mariners
1 had
1 sailed
1 many
1 leagues
1 westward
1 till
1 they
1 reached
1 a
1 shore
1 where
1 the
1 grape
1 grew
1 abundantly
1 these
1 and
1 other
1 considerations
1 have
1 made
1 it
1 the
1 fixed
1 persuasion
1 of
1 my
1 mind
1 that
1 there
1 is
1 a
1 great
1 discovery
1 reserved
1 for
1 the
1 man
1 who
1 will
1 sail
1 patiently
1 westward
1 trusting
1 in
1 God

1 and
1 turning
1 not
1 back
1 till
1 he
1 has
1 achieved
1 his
1 purpose
1 Don
1 G
1 Then
1 truly
1 we
1 should
1 never
1 hear
1 of
1 him
1 again
1 Speculation
1 mere
1 speculation
1 your
1 majesty
1 hen
1 this
1 gentleman
1 can
1 bring
1 forward

1 men
1 to
1 risk
1 money
1 in
1 forwarding
1 his

1 will
1 then

1 the
1 frivolity
1 of

1 jeering
1 at
1 what
1 they
1 do

1 and

1 DISCOVERY

1 1
1 At
1 sunrise
1 on
1 the
1 second
1 day
1 some
1 rashes
1 recently
1 torn
1 up
1 were
1 seen
1 near
1 the

1 A
1 plank
1 evidently
1 hewn
1 by
1 an
1 ax
1 a
1 stick
1 skillfully

1 a
1 bough
1 of

1 in
1 blossom
1 -
1 -and
1 lastly
1 a
1 bird
1 s
1 nest
1 built
1 on
1 a
1 branch
1 which
1 the
1 wind
1 had
1 broken
1 and
1 full
1 of
1 eggs
1 on
1 which
1 the
1 parent
1 bird
1 was
1 sitting
1 amid
1 the
1 gently
1 -rolling
1 waves
1 -
1 -were
1 seen
1 floating
1 past
1 on
1 the
1 waters
1 The
1 sailors
1 brought
1 on
1 board
1 these
1 living
1 and
1 inanimate
1 witnesses
1 of
1 their
1 approach
1 to
1 land
1 They
1 were
1 a
1 voice
1 from
1 the
1 shore
1 confirming
1 the
1 assurances
1 of
1 Columbus
1 Before
1 the
1 land
1 actually
1 appeared
1 in
1 sight
1 its
1 neighborhood
1 was
1 inferred
1 from
1 these
1 marks
1 of
1 life
1 2
1 The
1 mutineers
1 fell
1 on
1 their
1 knees
1 before
1 the
1 Admiral
1 whom
1 they
1 had
1 insulted
1 but
1 the
1 day
1 before
1 craved
1 pardon
1 for
1 their
1 mistrust
1 and
1 struck
1 up
1 a
1 hymn
1 of
1 thanksgiving
1 to
1 God
1 for
1 associating
1 them
1 with
1 this
1 triumph
1 Night
1 fell
1 on
1 these
1 songs
1 welcoming
1 a
1 new
1 world
1 The
1 Admiral
1 gave
1 orders
1 that
1 the
1 sails
1 should
1 be
1 close
1 -reefed
1 and
1 the
1 lead
1 kept
1 going
1 and
1 that
1 they
1 should
1 sail
1 slowly
1 being
1 afraid
1 of
1 breakers
1 and
1 shoals
1 and
1 feeling
1 certain
1 that
1 the
1 first
1 gleam
1 of
1 daybreak
1 would
1 discover
1 land
1 under
1 their
1 bows
1 3
1 On
1 the
1 last
1 anxious
1 night
1 none
1 slept
1 Impatient
1 expectation
1 had
1 removed
1 all
1 heaviness
1 from
1 their
1 eyes
1 the
1 pilots
1 and
1 the
1 seamen
1 clinging
1 about
1 the
1 masts
1 yards
1 and
1 shrouds
1 each
1 tried
1 to
1 keep
1 the
1 best
1 place
1 and
1 the
1 closest
1 watch
1 to
1 get
1 the
1 earliest
1 sight
1 of
1 the
1 new
1 hemisphere
1 The
1 Admiral
1 had
1 offered
1 a
1 reward
1 to
1 the
1 first
1 who
1 should
1 cry
1 Land
1 provided
1 his
1 announcement
1 was
1 verified
1 by
1 its
1 actual
1 discovery
1 4
1 Providence
1 however
1 reserved
1 to
1 Columbus
1 himself
1 this
1 first
1 glimpse
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 purchased
1 at
1 the
1 expense
1 of
1 twenty
1 years
1 of
1 his
1 life
1 and
1 of
1 untiring
1 perseverance
1 hile
1 walking
1 the
1 quarter
1 -deck
1 alone
1 at
1 midnight
1 and
1 sweeping
1 the
1 dark
1 horizon
1 with
1 his
1 keen
1 eye
1 a
1 gleam
1 of
1 fire
1 passed
1 and
1 disappeared
1 and
1 again
1 showed
1 itself
1 on
1 the
1 level
1 of
1 the
1 waves
1 Fearful
1 of
1 being
1 deceived
1 by
1 the
1 phosphorescence
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 he
1 quietly
1 called
1 a
1 Spanish
1 gentleman
1 of
1 Isabella
1 s
1 court
1 in
1 whom
1 he
1 had
1 more
1 confidence
1 than
1 in
1 the
1 pilots
1 pointed
1 out
1 the
1 direction
1 in
1 which
1 he
1 had
1 seen
1 the
1 light
1 and
1 asked
1 him
1 whether
1 he
1 could
1 discern
1 any
1 thing
1 there
1 5
1 He
1 replied
1 that
1 he
1 did
1 indeed
1 see
1 a
1 flickering
1 light
1 in
1 that
1 quarter
1 To
1 make
1 the
1 fact
1 still
1 more
1 sure
1 Columbus
1 called
1 another
1 in
1 whom
1 he
1 had
1 confidence
1 to
1 look
1 in
1 the
1 same
1 direction
1 He
1 said
1 he
1 had
1 no
1 hesitation
1 in
1 pronouncing
1 that
1 there
1 was
1 a
1 light
1 on
1 the
1 horizon
1 But
1 the
1 blaze
1 was
1 hardly
1 seen
1 before
1 it
1 again
1 disappeared
1 in
1 the
1 ocean
1 to
1 show
1 itself
1 anew
1 the
1 next
1 moment
1 hether
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 light
1 of
1 a
1 fire
1 on
1 a
1 low
1 shore
1 alternately
1 appearing
1 and
1 disappearing
1 beyond
1 the
1 broken
1 horizon
1 or
1 whether
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 floating
1 beacon
1 of
1 a
1 fisherman
1 s
1 boat
1 now
1 rising
1 on
1 the
1 waves
1 and
1 now
1 sinking
1 in
1 the
1 trough
1 of
1 the
1 sea
1 they
1 could
1 not
1 determine
1 6
1 Thus
1 both
1 land
1 and
1 safety
1 appeared
1 together
1 in
1 the
1 shape
1 of
1 fire
1 to
1 Columbus
1 and
1 his
1 two
1 friends
1 on
1 the
1 night
1 between
1 the
1 1
1 1th
1 and
1 1
1 2th
1 of
1 October
1 1
1 4
1 9
1 2
1 The
1 Admiral
1 enjoining
1 silence
1 kept
1 his
1 observation
1 to
1 himself
1 for
1 fear
1 of
1 again
1 raising
1 false
1 hopes
1 and
1 giving
1 a
1 bitter
1 disappointment
1 to
1 his
1 ships
1 companies
1 He
1 lost
1 sight
1 of
1 the
1 light
1 and
1 remained
1 on
1 deck
1 until
1 two
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 -
1 -praying
1 hoping
1 and
1 despairing
1 alone
1 awaiting
1 the
1 triumph
1 or
1 the
1 return
1 on
1 which
1 the
1 morrow
1 was
1 to
1 decide
1 7
1 He
1 was
1 seized
1 with
1 that
1 anguish
1 which
1 precedes
1 the
1 great
1 discoveries
1 of
1 truth
1 when
1 suddenly
1 a
1 cannon
1 -shot
1 sounding
1 over
1 the
1 sea
1 a
1 few
1 hundred
1 yards
1 in
1 advance
1 of
1 him
1 burst
1 upon
1 his
1 ear
1 the
1 announcement
1 of
1 a
1 new
1 -born
1 world
1 which
1 made
1 him
1 tremble
1 and
1 fall
1 upon
1 his
1 knees
1 It
1 was
1 the
1 signal
1 of
1 land
1 in
1 sight
1 made
1 by
1 firing
1 a
1 shot
1 as
1 had
1 been
1 arranged
1 with
1 the
1 Pinta
1 which
1 was
1 sailing
1 in
1 advance
1 of
1 the
1 squadron
1 to
1 guide
1 their
1 course
1 and
1 take
1 soundings
1 8
1 At
1 this
1 signal
1 a
1 general
1 shout
1 of
1 Land
1 ho
1 arose
1 from
1 all
1 the
1 yards
1 and
1 riggings
1 of
1 the
1 ships
1 The
1 sails
1 were
1 furled
1 and
1 daybreak
1 was
1 anxiously
1 awaited
1 The
1 mystery
1 of
1 the
1 ocean
1 had
1 breathed
1 its
1 first
1 whisper
1 in
1 the
1 bosom
1 of
1 night
1 Daybreak
1 would
1 clear
1 it
1 up
1 openly
1 to
1 every
1 eye
1 Delicious
1 and
1 unknown
1 perfumes
1 reached
1 the
1 vessels
1 from
1 the
1 outline
1 of
1 the
1 shore
1 with
1 the
1 roar
1 of
1 the
1 waves
1 upon
1 the
1 reefs
1 and
1 the
1 soft
1 land
1 breeze
1 9
1 The
1 fire
1 seen
1 by
1 Columbus
1 indicated
1 the
1 presence
1 of
1 man
1 and
1 of
1 the
1 first
1 element
1 of
1 civilization
1 Never
1 did
1 the
1 night
1 appear
1 so
1 long
1 in
1 clearing
1 away
1 from
1 the
1 horizon
1 for
1 this
1 horizon
1 was
1 to
1 Columbus
1 and
1 his
1 companions
1 a
1 second
1 creation
1 of
1 God
1 The
1 dawn
1 as
1 it
1 spread
1 over
1 the
1 sky
1 gradually
1 raised
1 the
1 shores
1 of
1 an
1 island
1 from
1 the
1 waves
1 Its
1 distant
1 extremities
1 were
1 lost
1 in
1 the
1 morning
1 mist
1 It
1 ascended
1 gradually
1 like
1 an
1 amphitheater
1 from
1 the
1 low
1 beach
1 to
1 the
1 summit
1 of
1 the
1 hills
1 whose
1 dark
1 -green
1 covering
1 contrasted
1 strongly
1 with
1 the
1 blue
1 heavens
1 1
1 0
1 ithin
1 a
1 few
1 paces
1 from
1 where
1 the
1 foam
1 of
1 the
1 waves
1 breaks
1 on
1 the
1 yellow
1 sand
1 forests
1 of
1 tall
1 and
1 unknown
1 trees
1 stretched
1 away
1 one
1 above
1 another
1 over
1 the
1 successive
1 terraces
1 of
1 the
1 island
1 Green
1 valleys
1 and
1 bright
1 clefts
1 in
1 the
1 hollows
1 afforded
1 a
1 half
1 glimpse
1 into
1 these
1 mysterious
1 wilds
1 Here
1 and
1 there
1 could
1 be
1 discovered
1 a
1 few
1 scattered
1 huts
1 which
1 with
1 their
1 outlines
1 and
1 roofs
1 of
1 dry
1 leaves
1 looked
1 like
1 bee
1 -hives
1 and
1 thin
1 columns
1 of
1 blue
1 smoke
1 rose
1 above
1 the
1 tops
1 of
1 the
1 trees
1 Half
1 -naked
1 groups
1 of
1 men
1 women
1 and
1 children
1 more
1 astonished
1 than
1 frightened
1 appeared
1 among
1 the
1 thickets
1 near
1 the
1 shore
1 advancing
1 timidly
1 and
1 then
1 drawing
1 back
1 exhibiting
1 by
1 their
1 gestures
1 and
1 demeanor
1 as
1 much
1 fear
1 as
1 curiosity
1 and
1 wonder
1 at
1 the
1 sight
1 of
1 these
1 strange
1 vessels
1 which
1 the
1 previous
1 night
1 had
1 brought
1 to
1 their
1 shores
1 1
1 1
1 Columbus
1 after
1 gazing
1 in
1 silence
1 on
1 this
1 foremost
1 shore
1 of
1 the
1 land
1 so
1 often
1 determined
1 by
1 his
1 calculations
1 and
1 so
1 magnificently
1 colored
1 by
1 his
1 imagination
1 found
1 it
1 to
1 exceed
1 even
1 his
1 own
1 expectations
1 He
1 burned
1 with
1 impatience
1 to
1 be
1 the
1 first
1 European
1 to
1 set
1 foot
1 on
1 the
1 sand
1 and
1 to
1 plant
1 the
1 flag
1 of
1 Spain
1 -
1 -the
1 standard
1 of
1 the
1 conquest
1 of
1 God
1 and
1 of
1 his
1 sovereigns
1 effected
1 by
1 his
1 genius
1 But
1 he
1 restrained
1 the
1 eagerness
1 of
1 himself
1 and
1 of
1 his
1 crew
1 to
1 land
1 being
1 desirous
1 of
1 giving
1 to
1 the
1 act
1 of
1 taking
1 possession
1 of
1 a
1 new
1 world
1 a
1 solemnity
1 worthy
1 of
1 the
1 greatest
1 deed
1 perhaps
1 ever
1 accomplished
1 by
1 a
1 seaman
1 and
1 in
1 default
1 of
1 men
1 to
1 call
1 God
1 and
1 His
1 angels
1 sea
1 earth
1 and
1 sky
1 as
1 witnesses
1 of
1 his
1 conquest
1 of
1 an
1 unknown
1 hemisphere
1 1
1 2
1 He
1 put
1 on
1 all
1 the
1 insignia
1 of
1 his
1 dignities
1 as
1 Admiral
1 of
1 the
1 Ocean
1 and
1 the
1 Viceroy
1 of
1 these
1 future
1 realms
1 he
1 wrapped
1 himself
1 in
1 his
1 purple
1 cloak
1 and
1 taking
1 in
1 his
1 hand
1 an
1 embroidered
1 flag
1 in
1 which
1 the
1 initials
1 of
1 Ferdinand
1 and
1 Isabella
1 were
1 interlaced
1 like
1 their
1 two
1 kingdoms
1 and
1 surmounted
1 by
1 a
1 crown
1 he
1 entered
1 his
1 boat
1 and
1 pulled
1 toward
1 the
1 shore
1 followed
1 by
1 the
1 boats
1 of
1 his
1 two
1 lieutenants
1 1
1 3
1 On
1 landing
1 he
1 fell
1 on
1 his
1 knees
1 to
1 acknowledge
1 by
1 this
1 act
1 of
1 humility
1 and
1 worship
1 the
1 goodness
1 and
1 greatness
1 of
1 God
1 in
1 this
1 new
1 sphere
1 of
1 His

1 He
1 kissed
1 the
1 ground
1 and
1 with
1 his
1 face
1 on
1 the
1 earth
1 he
1 wept
1 tears
1 of
1 double
1 import
1 as
1 they
1 fell
1 on
1 the
1 dust
1 of
1 this
1 hemisphere
1 now
1 for
1 the
1 first
1 time
1 visited
1 by

1 -
1 -tears
1 of
1 joy
1 for
1 the
1 overflowing
1 of
1 a
1 proud
1 spirit
1 grateful
1 and
1 pious
1 -
1 -tears
1 of
1 sadness
1 for
1 this
1 virgin
1 soil
1 seeming
1 to
1 foreshadow
1 the
1 calamities
1 and
1 devastation
1 with
1 fire
1 and
1 sword
1 and
1 blood
1 and
1 destruction
1 which
1 the
1 strangers
1 were
1 to
1 bring
1 with
1 their
1 pride
1 their
1 knowledge
1 and
1 their
1 power
1 1
1 4
1 It
1 was
1 the
1 man
1 that
1 shed
1 these
1 tears
1 but
1 it
1 was
1 the
1 earth
1 that
1 was
1 destined
1 to
1 weep
1 As
1 Columbus
1 raised
1 his
1 forehead
1 from
1 the
1 dust
1 with
1 a
1 Latin
1 prayer
1 which
1 his
1 companions
1 have
1 handed
1 down
1 to

1 he
1 thus
1 addressed
1 the
1 Sovereign
1 Ruler
1 of
1 the

1 sl
1 Almighty
1 and
1 eternal
1 God
1 who
1 by
1 the
1 energy
1 of
1 thy
1 creative
1 word
1 hast
1 made
1 the
1 firmament
1 the
1 earth
1 and

1 blessed
1 and
1 glorified
1 be
1 Thy
1 name
1 in

1 May
1 Thy
1 majesty
1 and

1 be

1 and

1 servants
1 in
1 this
1 hitherto
1 unknown
1 portion
1 of

1 empire
1 1
1 5
1 He
1 then

1 the

1 of

1 Salvador
1 His
1 lieutenants
1 his

1 full
1 of

1 and

1 for

1 Can
1 you
1 wonder

1 losing

1 Cousin
1 Cousin

1 that
1 would

1 temper
1 of

1 it
1 would
1 be
1 a

1 thing
1 for
1 you
1 though
1 I
1 should
1 pity
1 the
1 poor
1 fellow
1 who
1 found
1 it
1 Grim
1 You
1 are
1 growing
1 satirical
1 in
1 your
1 old
1 age
1 Cousin
1 Mary
1 Cousin
1 Cousin
1 Grim
1 hear
1 the
1 plain
1 truth
1 your

1 temper
1 makes
1 you
1 a
1 nuisance
1 to
1 yourself
1 and
1 every
1 body
1 about

1 Grim
1 Really
1 Miss

1 you

1 Cousin
1 No
1 I
1 am
1 getting
1 to
1 be
1 candid
1 I
1 have
1 passed
1 a
1 week
1 in
1 your
1 house
1 on
1 your
1 invitation
1 I
1 leave
1 you
1 this
1 afternoon
1 but
1 before
1 I
1 go
1 I
1 mean
1 to
1 speak
1 my
1 mind
1 Grim
1 It
1 seems
1 to
1 me
1 that
1 you
1 have
1 spoken
1 it
1 rather
1 freely
1 already
1 Cousin
1 hat
1 was
1 there
1 in
1 the
1 circumstance
1 of
1 poor
1 Michael
1 s
1 bringing
1 you
1 the
1 wrong
1 boots
1 to
1 justify
1 your
1 flying
1 into
1 a
1 rage
1 and
1 bellowing
1 as
1 if
1 your
1 life
1 had
1 been
1 threatened
1 Grim
1 That
1 fellow
1 is
1 perpetually
1 making
1 just
1 such
1 provoking
1 blunders
1 Cousin
1 And
1 do
1 you
1 never
1 make
1 provoking
1 blunders
1 Didn
1 t
1 you
1 send
1 me
1 five
1 pounds
1 of
1 Hyson
1 tea
1 when
1 I
1 wrote
1 for
1 Souchong
1 Didn
1 t
1 you
1 send
1 a
1 carriage
1 for
1 me
1 to
1 the
1 cars
1 half
1 an
1 hour
1 too
1 late
1 so
1 that
1 I
1 had
1 to
1 hire
1 one
1 myself
1 after
1 great
1 trouble
1 And
1 did
1 I
1 roar
1 at
1 you
1 when
1 we
1 met
1 because
1 you
1 had
1 done
1 these
1 things
1 Grim
1 On
1 the
1 contrary
1 this
1 is
1 the
1 first
1 time
1 you
1 have
1 alluded
1 to
1 them
1 I
1 am
1 sorry
1 they
1 should
1 have
1 happened
1 But
1 surely
1 you
1 should
1 make
1 a
1 distinction
1 between
1 any
1 such
1 little
1 oversight
1 of
1 mine
1 and
1 the
1 stupidity
1 of
1 a
1 servant
1 hired
1 to
1 attend
1 to
1 your
1 orders
1 Cousin
1 I
1 do
1 not
1 admit
1 that
1 there
1 should
1 be
1 a
1 distinction
1 You
1 are
1 both
1 human
1 only
1 as
1 you
1 have
1 had
1 the
1 better
1 education
1 and
1 the
1 greater
1 advantages
1 stupidity
1 or
1 neglect
1 on
1 your
1 part
1 is
1 much
1 the
1 more
1 culpable
1 Grim
1 Thank
1 you
1 Go
1 on
1 Cousin
1 I
1 mean
1 to
1 so
1 don
1 t
1 be
1 impatient
1 If
1 an
1 uncooked
1 potato
1 or
1 a
1 burnt
1 mutton
1 -chop
1 happens
1 to
1 fall
1 to
1 your
1 lot
1 at
1 the
1 dinner
1 -table
1 what
1 a
1 tempest
1 follows
1 One
1 would
1 think
1 you
1 had
1 been
1 wronged
1 insulted
1 trampled
1 on
1 driven
1 to
1 despair
1 Your
1 face
1 is
1 like
1 a
1 thunder
1 -cloud
1 all
1 the
1 rest
1 of
1 the
1 meal
1 Your
1 poor
1 wife
1 endeavors
1 to
1 hide
1 her
1 tears
1 Your
1 children
1 feel
1 timid
1 and
1 miserable
1 Your
1 guest
1 feels
1 as
1 if
1 she
1 would
1 like
1 to
1 see
1 you
1 held
1 under
1 the
1 nose
1 of
1 the
1 pump
1 and
1 thoroughly
1 ducked
1 Grim
1 The
1 carriage
1 is
1 waiting
1 for
1 you
1 Miss
1 Somerville
1 and
1 the
1 driver
1 has
1 put
1 on
1 your
1 baggage
1 Cousin
1 I
1 have
1 hired
1 that
1 carriage
1 by
1 the
1 hour
1 and
1 so
1 am
1 in
1 no
1 hurry
1 Your
1 excuse
1 for
1 your
1 irritability
1 will
1 be
1 I
1 suppose
1 that
1 it
1 is
1 constitutional
1 and
1 not
1 to
1 be
1 controlled
1 A
1 selfish
1 paltry
1 miserable
1 excuse
1 I
1 have
1 turned
1 down
1 a
1 leaf
1 in
1 Dr
1 Johnson
1 s
1 works
1 and
1 will
1 read
1 what
1 he
1 says
1 in
1 regard
1 to
1 tempers
1 like
1 yours
1 Grim
1 You
1 are
1 always
1 quoting
1 Dr
1 Johnson
1 Cousin
1 I
1 can
1 not
1 endure
1 it
1 Dr
1 Johnson
1 is
1 a
1 bore
1 Cousin
1 Oh
1 yes
1 to
1 evil
1 -doers
1 -
1 -but
1 to
1 none
1 else
1 Hear
1 him
1 There
1 is
1 in
1 the
1 world
1 a
1 class
1 of
1 mortals
1 known
1 and
1 contentedly
1 known
1 by
1 the
1 appellation
1 of
1 passionate
1 men
1 who
1 imagine
1 themselves
1 entitled
1 by
1 this
1 distinction
1 to
1 be
1 provoked
1 on
1 every
1 slight
1 occasion
1 and
1 to
1 vent
1 their
1 rage
1 in
1 vehement
1 and
1 fierce
1 vociferations
1 in
1 furious
1 menaces
1 and
1 licentious
1 reproaches
1 Grim
1 That
1 will
1 do
1 Cousin
1 Men
1 of
1 this
1 kind
1 he
1 tells
1 us
1 are
1 often
1 pitied
1 rather
1 than
1 censured
1 and
1 are
1 not
1 treated
1 with
1 the
1 severity
1 which
1 their
1 neglect
1 of
1 the
1 ease
1 of
1 all
1 about
1 them
1 might
1 justly
1 provoke
1 But
1 he
1 adds
1 It
1 is
1 surely
1 not
1 to
1 be
1 observed
1 without
1 indignation
1 that
1 men
1 may
1 be
1 found
1 of
1 minds
1 mean
1 enough
1 to
1 be
1 satisfied
1 with
1 this
1 treatment
1 wretches
1 who
1 are
1 proud
1 to
1 obtain
1 the
1 privilege
1 of
1 madmen
1 and
1 -
1 -
1 -
1 -
1 Grim
1 I
1 will
1 hear
1 no
1 more
1 Have
1 done
1 Cousin
1 So
1 the
1 shaft
1 went
1 home
1 I
1 am
1 not
1 sorry
1 Grim
1 No
1 one
1 but
1 a
1 meddlesome
1 old
1 maid
1 would
1 think
1 of
1 insulting
1 a
1 man
1 in
1 his
1 own
1 house
1 Cousin
1 So
1 when
1 at
1 a
1 loss
1 for
1 a
1 vindication
1 you
1 reproach
1 me
1 with
1 being
1 an
1 old
1 maid
1 Cousin
1 it
1 does
1 not
1 distress
1 me
1 either
1 to
1 be
1 an
1 old
1 maid
1 or
1 to
1 be
1 called
1 one
1 I
1 must
1 however
1 remark
1 that
1 the
1 manhood
1 that
1 can
1 charge
1 against
1 a
1 woman
1 her
1 single
1 state
1 either
1 as
1 a
1 matter
1 of
1 ridicule
1 or
1 reproach
1 is
1 not
1 quite
1 up
1 to
1 my
1 standard
1 Grim
1 Cousin
1 Mary
1 I
1 ask
1 your
1 pardon
1 But
1 am
1 I
1 indeed
1 the
1 petulant
1 disagreeable
1 fellow
1 you
1 would
1 make
1 me
1 out
1 Cousin
1 My
1 dear
1 Caspar
1 you
1 are
1 generous
1 enough
1 in
1 large
1 things
1 but
1 oh
1 consider
1 that
1 trifles
1 make
1 up
1 a
1 good
1 portion
1 of
1 the
1 sum
1 of
1 life
1 and
1 so
1 a
1 small
1 unkindness
1 is
1 a
1 great
1 offense
1 hy
1 not
1 be
1 cheerful

1 in

1 things

1 and
1 contented
1 by
1 reflecting
1 from
1 yourself
1 such
1 a
1 frame
1 of

1 upon
1 them
1 Life
1 is
1 short
1 at
1 the

1 why

1 Do

1 longevity
1 is
1 promoted
1 by
1 a
1 tranquil
1 happy
1 habit
1 of
1 thought
1 and

1 Do

1 like

1 is

1 blessed
1 blessing

1 demand
1 that

1 Do

1 to
1 shed

1 and
1 sorrow

1 by
1 your
1 moroseness
1 and

1 Cousin
1 Mary
1 the
1 patience
1 with
1 which
1 I
1 have
1 listened
1 to

1 will
1 prove
1 to
1 you
1 I
1 hope
1 that
1 notwithstanding
1 my
1 angry
1 retorts
1 I
1 am
1 convinced
1 there
1 is
1 much
1 truth
1 in

1 you
1 have
1 said
1 of

1 I
1 have
1 a
1 favor
1 to
1 ask
1 Send
1 away

1 stay
1 a
1 week
1 longer
1 -
1 -a
1 month
1 -
1 -a

1 if
1 you
1 will
1 Hold
1 the
1 lash
1 over
1 this
1 ugly
1 temper
1 of
1 mine
1 -
1 -and
1 I
1 give
1 you
1 my
1 word
1 that
1 I
1 will
1 set
1 about
1 the
1 cure
1 of
1 it
1 in
1 earnest
1 Cousin
1 You
1 should
1 have
1 begun
1 earlier
1 -
1 -in
1 youth
1 when
1 the
1 temper
1 is
1 pliable
1 and
1 strong
1 impressions
1 can
1 work
1 great
1 changes
1 But
1 we
1 will
1 not
1 despair
1 I
1 will
1 tarry
1 with
1 you
1 a

1 just
1 to

1 are
1 serious
1 in

1 Thank

1 and
1 why
